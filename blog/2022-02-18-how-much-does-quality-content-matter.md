The quality of your organization's technical documentation matters now more than ever. I have found in my experience that potential customers also evaluate the technical documentation carefully before they buy. Whether they're an IT professional evaluating an enterprise application or a consumer using a product, they're reading your content to learn about the product and how to use it.

If your prospective customers cannot find high-quality technical or user documentation to support their purchase decisions, you may never have a chance to close the deal. 

- Good informational content helps your prospects become customers. They want to understand your capabilities and unique value. 

- Good instructional content helps your customers *remain* your customers. They need fast, effective service.

Great technical documentation empowers the user. Not frustrate them. Plus, it's an integral part of customer support, branding, and trust. If it's not there for them, they start looking for alternatives.

## Costs and risks of content quality problems

There are several dimensions to good technical documentation:

- Can the reader find it and understand it?

- Is the content complete and accurate?

- Is there a consistent use of product branding and industry terminology? 

We can break these down further, but we'll stick with this high-level list for this article. 

### Accurate and complete
Technical documentation is living content that is continuously updated as new features are released. Because of this, it must be reviewed for accuracy and completeness. For example, is the expected behavior of the product feature accurately described? Are the procedural steps accurate and complete? 

Accurate and complete means the user accomplished what they set out to do because the information was in the documentation. However, they are at a dead end and left to call support if it's not there.

### Consistent
Inconsistencies can have a definite impact. For example, it can confuse users or affect the company's brand. In addition, the user might be confused about which content is correct, especially if your content uses several terms interchangeably. Finally, the translations by human and machine translators can contain these inconsistencies if your content is localized.

If your company has a valuable brand, you'll suffer a tangible loss if branding isn't used consistently.

### Findable
Today, it's more important to be able to search the content. In addition, technical documentation has evolved, especially over the past decade. Technical documentation is primarily in an online help format with an option to download a PDF version. With that said, SEO in technical documentation helps search engines respond with the most relevant content.

A great example of SEO in technical documentation comes from Microsoft. In their content, on docs.microsoft.com, the `description` metadata field is required and must follow the SEO writing guidelines.

### Understandable

Now that we've briefly touched on the "findable" aspect of this article let's talk about the other piece, "understandable." Even if the content is accurate, complete, and consistent, it might not be understood. Many factors come into play when we talk about whether someone understands it or not:

- **Sentence structure**: Does the sentence articulate the idea clearly and directly? Is the sentence so long it's too difficult to follow? Is the sentence too convoluted to understand? Does the sentence include information that adds nothing but confusion?

-  **Vocabulary**: Does the user understand the words? Is your content translated?

- **Terminology**: Are the terms used correctly and consistently throughout the documentation? 

- **Spelling and grammar**: Does the content contain relatively simple errors that distract, confuse, or mislead your readers?
