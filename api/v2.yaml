    - **Project**: CareerFoundry assignment; write an API for a movie app
    - **Description**: Written for the b-movie app I've been developing.
    - **Date**: July 8, 2022
    # Introduction
    This API lets users access information about different b-movies, such as directors, actors, genre, and year of release. It also allows them to sign up to create a list of their favorite b-movies. They can also remove movies from their favorites and even unregister from the movie app if they'd like.
