        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Single sourcing is a simple idea that is often misunderstood. Most of the time people think that single sourcing means that the online help and user manuals must be identical in terms of content. This is an incorrect assumption. Single sourcing is creating a single content source then producing different types of documentation from it. Single sourcing takes into account for the differing needs of all of your audiences and the strengths and weaknesses of each of your output media (Darley, p. 3). </p><p>In a nutshell, single sourcing is just a development strategy that enables writers to develop centralized information modules, then map them to distinct audiences, or media, or both without recreating the content for the other document formats.  For example, with single sourcing you can map the content to your online help, website, marking material, user's guides, and training manuals. Another advantage to single sourcing is that when you update the information module, the other document formats (i.e., online help and printed media) are automatically updated.</p><p>For technical writers, single sourcing means modular writing and information mapping. Rather than developing information for a given format, such as a user's guide or online help, writers develop information modules at the element level (i.e., section, paragraph, and sentence). The information modules are then mapped to preselected audiences and media. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="references">References:<a class="hash-link" href="#references" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Darley, J.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let's face it, everyone likes learning something new. Your audience is a curious bunch, no matter who they are, which is why how-to/explainer videos are perfect for any target audience. These videos are short, engaging breakdowns of broader concepts or tasks. They are also one of the most effective ways to quickly show viewers a big idea or how to do something. How-to/explainer videos must be easy to consume, and to achieve this, the information delivered must be clear.</p><p>A well-produced video can undoubtedly enhance the experience for your viewers, but a well-produced video takes planning to meet a high standard of quality and clarity. Many people begin without knowing where to start or realizing the extent of the work involved. Video production is not a simple matter of recording and pressing play when you're done. It takes several hours to make a few minutes of high-quality video. A few tasks in creating a well-produced vide include planning, script writing, recording the video, recording and editing the voiceover, and rendering. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="what-qualities-make-a-great-how-to-video">What qualities make a great how-to video?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-qualities-make-a-great-how-to-video" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As you read this article, think about your own experience as a viewer. What did you find helpful and not so helpful about the video? Was the message clear, did it flow and stick to the intended message, and did it keep you engaged throughout?  Most importantly, did you get what you needed out of the video or did it waste your time and you didn't get much out of it?  </p><p>The following four qualities give you some guidance from planning to writing a solid script to recording your video and selecting a voiceover professional. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="1-having-a-good-script-with-a-clear-message-matters">1. Having a good script with a clear message matters<a class="hash-link" href="#1-having-a-good-script-with-a-clear-message-matters" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you have a world-class product, a weak script sabotages your video, making it boring at best and confusing at worst. Always plan what you're going to say. It's easy to ramble when you record. Instead, have a plan.</p><blockquote><p>An excellent how-to video script takes work.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Define your message.</strong> Start by making a creative brief to establish the audience, goals, problems, solutions, and the proper tone. Next, you'll want to start with the actual words. This is necessary to help tailor the message. Be straight forward and confident in your message. Keep these things in mind when defining your message:</p><ol><li><p>Why the video, and what's your angle? Don't make a video for the fun of it. Know your goal because you're either filling in an information gap or expanding your viewer's knowledge. HOW are you making life easier for them?</p></li><li><p>Why will the viewer care? What are their pain points? What are they trying to solve?</p></li><li><p>Anticipate the viewer's questions and make sure they get answered.</p></li><li><p>What value will this provide to the viewer?</p></li><li><p>What should the viewer take away from this video? Your conclusion should have an impact. If your video is sharp up until a shrug of a closer, all your work will be for nothing. You shouldn't end with an overtly sales-based message, but instead, there should be a final takeaway.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Communicate your brand.</strong> If you're only mentioning features in your video, then you're just playing it safe. Your viewers want to know how things impact them. Even if it's common sense, tell the viewer about how your product or idea benefits <strong>them</strong>. Consider what you'd like to hear if "you" were the customer. You're positioning the product as the "Secret Sauce" to solve or prevent the problem. After you put in the secret sauce, explain "Why" it works.</p></li><li><p><strong>Work with a professional scriptwriter.</strong> The script is the message of the video; it's what you want to tell and transmit in the video.
The writer helps "engage" the right audience and make them want to learn more (and keep on watching). The writer also helps keep the length of video
at just the right length; the longer the video, the more view drops it's likely to have.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="2-high-quality-video-recordings">2. High-quality video recordings<a class="hash-link" href="#2-high-quality-video-recordings" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>You can record anything and everything on your screen, but it can end up as a not-so-great viewing experience. We get that not everyone uses the same  recording software, but here are a few things to ensure consistency for the best recording quality and viewing experience:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set up your desktop recording area and your recording software.</strong> Do not record "full screen" because it can record at a "not-so-great" aspect ratio.   Recording at 1280x720 may seem small, but it's considered HD, plus it's the recommended size for YouTube videos.</p><p> <img src="https://www.pscmdesigns.com/images/16-9-ratio.png" alt="16:9 ratio"> </p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip!</strong> You can make a 1280 x 720px placeholder image for your desktop and then re-size any browser or application within the white space before you
start to record.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Recording workflow and tips.</strong> What we want is a smooth transition during mouse movements and screen changes so that no further editing is needed during postproduction.</p><ol><li><p>De-clutter and clean up your desktop.</p></li><li><p>Close unused applications.</p></li><li><p>Turn off notifications and disable pop-ups.</p></li><li><p>Open the application you want to record and then do a couple of practice walkthroughs of precisely what you want to show your viewers. This helps with smooth cursor motions, and, in the end, there's less editing to do for the video production specialist.</p></li><li><p>When you're ready to record, start the recording and follow these tips:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Watch your mouse cursor.</strong> You'll use it to show the viewer where to follow along with while you explain things. It's essential, so make sure you make it as useful as possible.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Don't circle things.</strong> Moving your mouse around and around as if you're talking with your hands leaves your viewers confused and unsure of where they should look. Instead, move it deliberately and with purpose.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don't move it at the speed of light.</strong> If you're moving your mouse across the screen too fast, your audience struggles to follow along, and, ultimately, stops watching.</p></li><li><p><strong>If you can, try to cut out mistakes and unneeded content</strong>. Mistakes happen to the best of us. You'll be recording, and your mouse moves to the wrong place, you click the wrong thing, or something unexpected happens. It's okay – it's fixable.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Allow 5 seconds of silence before beginning your tutorial</strong> (following along with the script). This allows a buffer, so you don't cut off anything you meant to record on the screen.</p></li><li><p><strong>As you record, speak in a conversational tone (following the script),</strong> as if you were training someone that is sitting next to you. Be straightforward with your language. Take your time to say WHAT you're doing and WHY you're doing it. Let the actions speak for themselves.</p><p>Talking as you record helps with the smooth transition and stays at a pace that you would typically see in a one-on-one training session. Plus, when you speak following along with the script, the professional voiceover can be efficiently timed with the actions. Don't worry about fumbling over your words because your audio is edited out during postproduction.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip!</strong> If you go off-script, but it's a valuable tidbit for the user, the script can be modified for the voiceover professional.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Allow 5 seconds of silence at the end of the recording</strong>. Here you want to make sure you don't cut anything off.</p></li></ul></li></ol></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="3-utilize-a-voiceover-professional">3. Utilize a voiceover professional<a class="hash-link" href="#3-utilize-a-voiceover-professional" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The quality of the narration makes a big difference in the overall quality of your video. Let's face it, folks, lousy narration turns off viewers faster than almost anything else. So, the importance of a clear and articulate voice in visual content is undeniable. If you want to reach a broad audience and keep them engaged, then the narration must be excellent. Webinars and presentations can be ruined by using the wrong voice. As a result, viewers turn their attention to the voice behind the message.</p><p>Getting and keeping your viewers' attention is why you need professional voiceovers. They are persuasive and give the right rhythm to your script. They train their voices for years and know how to make any communication exciting and easy to follow. Plus, they enjoy their jobs and smile, which can be heard in their voice and makes your video content more appealing. Professional voiceovers know how to control breath and rhythm so that the audience doesn't hear any disturbing pauses while listening.</p><p>Without the right voice to match the tone of the video, an otherwise exceptional video is dead. Hire a professional whose sound resonates with your audience. Find someone who specializes in the genre. You'd be surprised how many voiceover professionals specialize in a particular genre, such as technical or medical content. Professional voiceover is excellent, and (if you have the budget), bringing one in-house to record is always the best approach.</p><p>Your videos say a lot about your company and the way you do business. And people tend to associate the quality of your content with the quality of your products or services.</p><blockquote><p>Source:
