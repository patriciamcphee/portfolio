Reading is the primary action people perform online, but people strive to read as little as possible. They rely on scanning instead. Thoughtful editing, strategic structuring, and effective formatting of long-form content supports scanning.

***Start with an outline*** of the main content (divided into clear sections) and a final section for additional guidance (**Next steps**) or related resources (**You might also be interested in**).

The following is a general structure for content. Remember, depending on the "Templates and content types" and template you use, the structure might be a bit different.

## Intro paragraph

You don't need to include a header for this section since this is introducing the document. <br />- Clearly state what the user will learn or achieve in your introduction paragraph: **50-150 words**.  This range is the "just enough" or "ideal" range because it provides enough context without overwhelming the user. Think of this as the *Abstract* of an essay or research article—it's a brief summary of the content's key points. This also applies to the intro paragraphs for the headings and subheadings of the document.  Keep in mind that the user likely doesn't have time to sift through mountains of information. <br /><br />Here's an example of what 100 words looks like:<br /><br />Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque convallis dapibus tempus. Aenean finibus sit amet ligula id congue. Donec id velit lacinia sapien molestie congue. Aliquam id dui vitae augue maximus tempus. Mauris at malesuada ante, ac imperdiet nisi. Donec dapibus tellus justo, ac rutrum lorem imperdiet porta. Fusce. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque convallis dapibus tempus. Aenean finibus sit amet ligula id congue. Donec id velit lacinia sapien molestie congue. Aliquam id dui vitae augue maximus tempus. Mauris at malesuada ante, ac imperdiet nisi. Donec dapibus tellus justo, ac rutrum lorem imperdiet porta. Fusce.


## Main body structure

Mention any **Prerequisites** or anything the user must have knowledge of or know. This includes applications or platforms installed/configured.  <br />- [Organize the content](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/layer-cake-pattern-scanning/) into distinct sections based on specific topics or concepts and use clear headings and subheadings for each section.  Present information in a logical order following the [inverted pyramid style](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/).<br /><br />Are you drawing a blank with what common sections to include? No matter the template you use, you can include any of the following sections in the body structure in a logical order. This helps make the content easier to scan ( [**Layer Cake-pattern**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-people-read-online/) for scanning text).<br /><br />- - - **Background and context** — Great for new ideas, proof of concepts, scenarios, or troubleshooting.<br />        - **Scenarios and examples** — Give users real-life use cases and applications.<br />        - **Tips and best practices** — Advice for optimal use and efficiency.<br />        - **FAQs** — Answers common questions related to the content.<br />        - **Troubleshooting** — Solutions for common issues.  <br />              <br />            <br />- Start each paragraph with a ***topic sentence*** .     Remember, this helps make the content easier to scan ( [**F-pattern**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-people-read-online/) for scanning text).


## Ending the document

Instead of a traditional conclusion, you can include one, two, or all three to end of your document:<br /><br />- **Key takeaways** — Summarize the most critical points or concepts covered in the document.<br />- **Next steps** — Direct the user on what to do next. This can include subsequent procedures or how to apply the information they've just learned.<br />- **You might also be interested in** — Direct users to related documentation or resources. This section helps users expand their knowledge or explore related topics. |
