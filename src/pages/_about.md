# About me

I've been in the Tech Industry since the late 1990s, starting in support and moving to network system administration. However, for the past two decades, I've been taking the guesswork out of complex technical content and helping people navigate, use and troubleshoot products.  

My journey into UX Technical Writer / Content Strategist started with the Human-Centered Design & Engineering team at a large telecommunications company. There I learned how to conduct usability tests (participant observation and user behavior) to uncover and solve user experience challenges with end-user documentation.  

Over the past two decades, I've helped organizations reduce, simplify, and restructure their digital end-user documentation, ensuring quality and accuracy and increasing customer satisfaction rates.
