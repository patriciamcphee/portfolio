## General



**Q. Are the progress bars limited to one theme as the bar progresses throughout the values (0-100%)?**

Is it possible to progress from a standard theme to a positive theme once it meets a certain threshold? 

A. Progress _bar_ has three themes and doesn't have the intelligence to switch between them internally. That can be part of the implementing component to switch between the themes based on some logic.

## Components

**Q. How do you tell when components or features are shipped and ready to use within Figma?**

The observed problem is that designers have been using components from the PSCM library, then after handing it off to developers, they find out the component isnâ€™t fully graduated. 

A. We have a [component graduation process page in Confluence](https://jira.expedia.biz/secure/StructureBoard.jspa?s=2472) that shows where components are in development for each platform.

**Q. What are the guidelines for when to use or not use a popover?**  

Is the popnote documentation saying the bottom sheet should be used in all cases on small devices?


A. Yes, the guidance recommends using a bottom sheet on small devices. 

## Mobile 

**Q. Are the nav bars in iOS and the top app bar in Android built using the native equivalents (Swift and Material), or were they built from the ground up?**

A. EGToolbar in iOS Swift is a custom component, not the default OS version.
