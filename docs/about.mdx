- Graphic and visual design (newsletters, brochures, and eBooks)
- Full stack and responsive web development (React/Express/Node.js)
- Scenario-based technical content development for IT professionals 
- Innovating, collaborating with colleagues, and expanding my skills


## Becoming a Content Designer
<!-- Include file -->
I'm a Sr. Content Designer and UX Writer that's been in the Tech Industry for 25 years, starting in support and moving to network system administration. However, for the past 20 years, I've been a Technical Writer taking the guesswork out of complex technical content. I started my technical writing career on the Human Factors (Human-Centered Design & Engineering) team at a large telecommunications company. There, I learned how to conduct usability tests (participant observation) to uncover and solve user experience (UX) challenges early in my career.  

Over the last 12 years, I've helped organizations reduce, simplify, and restructure their content, ensuring quality and accuracy, and increasing customer satisfaction rates.

## What I do as a Content Designer

- Drive cohesive product narratives across products and services.
- Think through projects strategically and creatively, from ideation through production, working with cross-functional teams (Design, Product, Marketing, and Support) to uncover and solve UX challenges.
- Strategize, implement, and maintain a consistent content strategy through the product experience.
- Use empathy, logic, and data to inform writing, editing, and design decisions.
- Apply customer-centric thinking to all product design elements, focusing on clarity, coherence, quality, accessibility, and mapping out content flows.
- Integrate storytelling for increased stakeholder engagement. Oscillate between left- and right-brained writing, from storytelling to systematic thinking.
- Develop guidelines, create architect frameworks, and inform design solutions.
- Create content that follows all guidelines, including UX content, SEO, accessibility, design system, localization, and legal.
- Use the [minimalism](https://www.stilo.com/2017/05/04/dita-and-minimalism/#:~:text=Minimalism%2C%20when%20applied%20to%20technical%20writing%2C%20should%20result,2%20Usable%203%20Minimal%204%20Appropriate%205%20Findable) approach to create usable content that is clear and simple without unnecessary distractions.
- Thrive in a collaborative and feedback-rich environment.
- Ask lots of questions.
- Think long-term, but act quickly.


## Where I'm going next in my career

About 12 years ago, I no longer felt fulfilled with Technical Writing. So I started to explore different careers like Medical Writer, Voiceover/Voice Actor ([listen to my demos](https://soundcloud.com/patriciamcphee/sets/voiceover-demos)), or returning to my roots as a Graphic Designer. I even considered becoming a UX/UI Designer, Instructional Designer, or Web Developer.   

During all of my exploring, I discovered that I enjoy developing content management systems using static-site generators like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) docs-as-code frameworks. So after exploring these possibilities, I decided to learn Full Stack Web Development through [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/). 

My goal is to bring my programming skills up to par and graduate by September 2022. After that, I'll reach for and grab a UX Design certificate by March 2023 to transition into a UX/UI Design role, **UX Unicorn**, or **Full-stack designer** (whatever it's called these days).
