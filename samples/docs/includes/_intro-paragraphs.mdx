Clearly state what the user will learn or achieve in your introduction paragraph: 50-150 words.  This range is the "just enough" or "ideal" range because it provides enough context without overwhelming the user. Think of this as the Abstract of an essay or research article—it's a brief summary of the content's key points. This also applies to the intro paragraphs for the headings and subheadings of the document.  Keep in mind that the user likely doesn't have time to sift through mountains of information.


Avoid starting with phrases such as "This topic describes..." or "This topic is about...."

Instead, use something like, "In this guide, you'll do XYZ (what they will accomplish by the end) or "In this article, you'll...."

### Recommended

"In this &#060;guide/topic&#062;, you'll set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. We'll walk you through the initial setup, explain how to automate your build and testing processes, and show you how to deploy code changes to your prod environment efficiently. By the end, you'll have a fully functional CI/CD pipeline that accelerates your software development and deployment workflow."

_This example directly engages the reader with a clear outline of actions and outcomes._

### Not Recommended

"This topic describes how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. It will cover the initial setup, the process of automating builds and tests, and the deployment of code changes to production. This topic is about providing you with the knowledge to create a CI/CD pipeline that improves your software development and deployment processes."

_This example passively describes the content of the guide, making it less inviting and engaging._
