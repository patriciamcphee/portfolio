|Field  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`id`     | string        | A unique identifier for the document. It must not be duplicated within the documentation set. |
|`title`     | string        | The title of the document, written in title case, representing the primary subject of the topic. |
|`description`     |  string       | A concise summary of the document's content, between 20-50 words, written to provide clear context. |
|`keywords`     | string        | An array of terms or phrases that represent the document's content, helping improve searchability. The search plugin relies on these keywords rather than crawling the entire page, so ensure they accurately reflect the document's key topics. |  
|`doc_type`     | string        | The category or type of the document, such as reference, how-to, overview, concept, or troubleshooting. |
|`last_update:date`     |  string       |  The date when the document was last updated with significant changes. This date is displayed in search results, so it should reflect meaningful updates rather than minor edits like typos.  |
| `last_update:author` | string | The name of the topic's subject matter expert (SME) or primary contributor, responsible for the content. |
| `displayed_sidebar`  | string  |  Specifies the sidebar in which the document will appear, for example, mainSidebar (default). |
