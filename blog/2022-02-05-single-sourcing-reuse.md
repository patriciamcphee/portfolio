Single sourcing is a simple idea that is often misunderstood. Most of the time people think that single sourcing means that the online help and user manuals must be identical in terms of content. This is an incorrect assumption. Single sourcing is creating a single content source then producing different types of documentation from it. Single sourcing takes into account for the differing needs of all of your audiences and the strengths and weaknesses of each of your output media (Darley, p. 3).

In a nutshell, single sourcing is just a development strategy that enables writers to develop centralized information modules, then map them to distinct audiences, or media, or both without recreating the content for the other document formats.  For example, with single sourcing you can map the content to your online help, website, marking material, user's guides, and training manuals. Another advantage to single sourcing is that when you update the information module, the other document formats (i.e., online help and printed media) are automatically updated.

For technical writers, single sourcing means modular writing and information mapping. Rather than developing information for a given format, such as a user's guide or online help, writers develop information modules at the element level (i.e., section, paragraph, and sentence). The information modules are then mapped to preselected audiences and media.
