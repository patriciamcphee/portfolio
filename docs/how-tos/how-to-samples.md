How-tos are easy-to-follow instructions that explain step-by-step how to perform a task or use a specific feature in an app. How-tos are focused procedural articles that help you complete a task.  For example, making cookies includes the ingredients, mixing them, and how and at what temperature to bake them. 

When I write how-to's, I use the [minimalism](https://www.technicallywriteit.com/the-art-of-saying-less-minimalism/) approach.
