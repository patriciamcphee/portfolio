Reusability is the key to scalability by creating content once and using it everywhere (or in multiple places). 

You can achieve this through structured content, which deconstructs content into "blocks" that you use to restructure to create new experiences.

Topics should be:

- *Individually authorable*. Each topic is about one area and can be created on its own.

- *Always reusable*. A single topic can appear in multiple places and across different channels, so it should be free of being locked to specific content or layout and be used anywhere.

- *Independently understandable*. Each topic should be sufficiently complete so that it can be presented alone. In other words, the topic can stand alone without context but can also be used with context.

Examples include notes, cautions, standard steps in a task-oriented or scenario, or goal-based topics like an integration guide. A better example would be the “Configure SCOOBY” section of the integration guides because they all have this section. Therefore, we would only update the reusable topic if these instructions change.

## Benefits of content reuse

Assuming ProductA and ProductB are in the same content/document management system, reusing content benefits product documentation in these critical areas:

- **Increased consistency.** Reusing the topic through a content management system helps ensure that the topic is consistent wherever it is used.

- **Reduced content development and maintenance.** A topic is written once and stored in a content management system. As a result, development costs are reduced because a topic can be retrieved for reuse. In addition, changes to a topic can be applied everywhere the topic is used.

- **Rapid reconfiguration.** Using smaller units of information, such as a topic, makes it easier to change the order of the topics, include new topics, and exclude existing topics. Topics can be used to build new articles.

## Guidelines for content reuse

Writing for reuse requires writing without context. These guidelines help to make sure that topics are written for reuse in a variety of contexts.

- **Make few assumptions about reading order** because you might not know how users come to the topic. Also, depending on the context, topics within a collection might be organized differently.

- **Provide contextual cues** to help readers understand where information belongs within a large structure. For example, if sequential order is important in a complex task, provide a sense of what comes before and after a topic.

- **Give the precise location of related information.** Avoid the words *above* or *below* in the text as much as possible. These indicators have no meaning in a non-linear context. Instead, use *next* or *previous* if the information is contained in the same topic (article in our case).
