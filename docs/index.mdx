<h2>About Me!</h2>

My journey into user-centric writing started over 20 years ago on a human-centered design and engineering team at a large telecommunications company. There, I learned how to conduct usability tests (participant observation and user behavior) to uncover and solve user experience challenges with end-user documentation.

As a technical writer with 27 years of experience, I have honed my ability to distill complex information into straightforward, concise, and user-friendly content. Through my work, I have developed a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of communicating effectively with diverse audiences. These skills are essential in content design, content development, UX Writing, and creating experiences that are engaging but also accurate and informative.

Throughout my career, I have been involved in various documentation projects, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, including software developers, UX designers, and product managers. This experience has given me a holistic understanding of the software development lifecycle and the importance of seamless communication between users and technology. I am adept at understanding user needs and applying user-centered design principles to create an experience that meet the end user's expectations and goals.

Key strengths that I bring to my roles include the following:

  <Grid item>
  <p><CheckCircleIcon style={{ fontSize: '24px', color: '#9ecd28' }} /></p>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item xs>
  <p>I can give your product a competitive edge with powerful content targeted to any audienceâ€”novice to expert.</p>

  <Grid item xs>
  <p>I possess a strong technical background that allows me to quickly understand and translate complex technical concepts into accessible language for non-technical users.</p>

<h2>About this site</h2>

I used [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to build this writing portfolio. I started using Docusaurus at the beginning of 2020 and continue to play around with customization. Before that, I used other static-site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, and DocFx as my primary authoring environment. So far, my favorite is Docusaurus. Although I like DocFx, it's more complicated to set up.

The purpose of using the Docusaurus framework to host my writing samples was to make it easier to share and showcase my work!
