            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we create something, we also need to describe how to use it. With information architecture, how we group and label things directly affect how easily the information can be found and used. Information architecture becomes even more important as the information available keeps growing. When faced with a lot of information, it becomes harder to sift through and find what you need.</p><p>When the information architecture is good, people can find their way through the information and ignore what isn't relevant. Not only does good information architecture help people find information, but it also empowers them by helping them find the information they need, learn about it, and make better decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Bad information architecture makes it harder to find and use information, and the content doesn't easily fit. Good information architecture for an online store, for example, would group all the candy bars together and group them with other snack foods. Bad information architecture may group the items by the manufacturer, making people look through every manufacturer to see which ones make candy bars.&nbsp;Can you imagine if Amazon had bad information architecture? This also applies to end-user content.  You don't want your users going on a scavenger hunt for the content they need.  </p><p>Information architecture isn't easy for any number of reasons:</p><ul><li>There's always more than one way to organize it, and unfortunately, it isn't always clear what's the best way.</li><li>People have different needs. In a corporation, for example, a designer has different needs than a developer or product manager.&nbsp;</li><li>People often have different ideas on what goes together and what doesn't. This is because of their differences in needs.</li><li>Some people may know a lot about a topic, while others may know nothing (expert vs. novice).</li></ul><p>As you can see, the last three reasons are related to PEOPLE. Organizing things in a way that makes sense to them fits with their idea of what goes together.&nbsp;</p><p>There are three crucial things to understand before designing an IA that works:</p><ul><li><strong>People/Users:</strong> What they need to do, how they think, and what they already know. To put it into perspective, think of this as "need to know" vs. "need to do." If you don't understand the user, you won't be able to group content in ways that make sense to them. Cloud Architects, for example, consult end-user documentation because they're trying to do something and need instructions on how to do it. In this particular case, you wouldn't want to bury conceptual information in the topic because it's assumed they know this information. See where I'm going with this? Your audience is key to your IA decisions.  </li><li><strong>Content:</strong> What you have, what you should have, and what you need. Without a good understanding of your content, you won't be able to create an information architecture that works well for current and future content.</li><li><strong>Context:</strong> The business or personal goals for the site: your stakeholders and constraints. If you don't know the context, you won't be able to create something that works for people and the business, and you'll have endless trouble with the project.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="whats-involved-in-the-information-architecture-project">What's involved in the information architecture project<a href="#whats-involved-in-the-information-architecture-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's involved in the information architecture project" title="Direct link to What's involved in the information architecture project">​</a></h2><p>An IA project always starts with figuring out what is involved:</p><ul class="contains-task-list containsTaskList_kggB"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Define the project</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Identify goals</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Identify technologies used</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Identify design constraints</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Identify stakeholders</li></ul><p>After defining and identifying the project, you'll start gathering information and analyzing it to help you make a wide range of decisions during the project's life. In the research and gathering phase of the project, you're finding out what the users need, what they want, and what they know. You're also learning about the content, what exists, what doesn't, and what is possible. </p><p>Don't forget to observe user behavior and what questions they ask because these two are essential to the IA design. When I put myself into a "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom" mindset, I will watch users in their natural habitat when they reach a pain point. What do they do? Do they go to the documentation, and if so, how long do they spend before they give up? If they don't go to the official documentation, are they seeking out blogs or forums to get their answers? Directly asking them might not give you much because of their "muscle memory."</p><p>Once you've researched and learned about the user, the Information Architect (Technical Writer in this case) designs the solutions with an IA structure to the defined problems and goals. At this point, testing ensures the navigation works for the specified goals. If new content needs to be prepared, this is the time to start. </p><p>Without research into people and content, you won't be able to make good information architecture design decisions. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="deliverables-of-the-information-architecture-project">Deliverables of the information architecture project<a href="#deliverables-of-the-information-architecture-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deliverables of the information architecture project" title="Direct link to Deliverables of the information architecture project">​</a></h2><p>After all of the details and IA structure have been sorted out and you know the details of how the site should work, you can start the technical work—build the site, add content, and test it before release.&nbsp;</p><p>The IA deliverables include:</p><ul><li>The overall structure of the site.</li><li>Groups and subgroups that will be used in navigation. This describes what is included in each and the labeling.</li><li>Metadata that describes each page/topic, including keywords, author, reviewers, and date (last modified).</li></ul><p>The person creating the IA is the one who understands all the ins and outs because they understand the strategy, people, and content. This means they'll explain how the information architecture should work and other details about the project. The person will also listen to feedback, answer questions, understand the underlying issues that come up, and make changes as necessary to reach the desired outcome.</p><div class="ant-divider css-ed5zg0 ant-divider-horizontal" role="separator"></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The quality of your organization's technical documentation matters now more than ever. I have found in my experience that potential customers also evaluate the technical documentation carefully before they buy. Whether an IT professional evaluating an enterprise application, a developer implementing an API, or a consumer using a product, they're reading your content to learn about the product and how to use it.</p><p>If your prospective customers cannot find high-quality technical or user documentation to support their purchase decisions, you may never have a chance to close the deal.</p><ul><li><p>Good <strong>informational</strong> content helps your prospects become customers. They want to understand your capabilities and unique value. However, know that this type of content falls more into the hands of Marketing and Sales. It's the bait on the hook, so to speak.</p></li><li><p>Good <strong>instructional</strong> content and technical documentation help your customers <em>remain</em> your customers. They need fast, effective service. Organizing content around user roles and activities <em>empowers</em> them rather than frustrates them. Plus, it's an integral part of customer support, branding, and trust. If it's not there for them, they start looking for alternatives.</p></li></ul><p>In this article, you'll learn about content quality problems and learn ways to course-correct so that you create a good user experience when they use your product or service.  </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="costs-and-risks-of-content-quality-problems">Costs and risks of content quality problems<a href="#costs-and-risks-of-content-quality-problems" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Costs and risks of content quality problems" title="Direct link to Costs and risks of content quality problems">​</a></h2><p>There are several dimensions to good technical documentation:</p><ul><li><p>Can the reader find it and understand it?</p></li><li><p>Is the content complete and accurate?</p></li><li><p>Is there a consistent use of product branding and industry terminology?</p></li></ul><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_WoCw"><div class="admonitionHeading_TMsN"><span class="admonitionIcon_Ibzs"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_vXIg"><p>We can break these down further, but we'll stick with this high-level list for this article.</p></div></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="findable">Findable<a href="#findable" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Findable" title="Direct link to Findable">​</a></h3><p>Today, it's more important to be able to search the content.

Because of this, it must be reviewed for accuracy and completeness. Is the expected behavior of the product feature accurately described? Are the procedural steps accurate and complete?</p><p>Accurate and complete means the user accomplished what they set out to do because the information was in the documentation. However, they're at a dead-end and left to call support if it's not there.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="consistent">Consistent<a href="#consistent" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consistent" title="Direct link to Consistent">​</a></h3><p>If your company has a valuable brand, you'll suffer a tangible loss if branding isn't used consistently. Inconsistencies can confuse users or affect the company's brand. For example, the user might be confused about which content is correct, mainly if your content uses several terms interchangeably. In addition, the translations by human and machine translators can contain these inconsistencies if your content is localized.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="understandable">Understandable<a href="#understandable" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understandable" title="Direct link to Understandable">​</a></h3><p>Even if the content is accurate, complete, and consistent, it might not be understood. This is because so many factors come into play when we talk about whether someone understands it or not:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Sentence structure</strong>: Does the sentence articulate the idea clearly and directly? Is the sentence so long it's too difficult to follow? Is the sentence too convoluted to understand? Does the sentence include information that adds nothing but confusion?</p></li><li><p><strong>Vocabulary</strong>: Does the user understand the words? Is your content translated?</p></li><li><p><strong>Terminology</strong>: Are the terms used correctly and consistently throughout the documentation?</p></li><li><p><strong>Spelling and grammar</strong>: Does the content contain relatively simple errors that distract, confuse, or mislead your readers?</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="where-content-quality-problems-come-from">Where content quality problems come from<a href="#where-content-quality-problems-come-from" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Where content quality problems come from" title="Direct link to Where content quality problems come from">​</a></h2><p>Content quality problems can come from different areas. The top problem I've observed is that the user is misunderstood—that is, the overall user journey is overlooked. For example, IT professionals and developers are often misunderstood, so their content doesn't directly speak to them. What do I mean by this? Most often, the content is written by a very technical person, and then it's handed off for editing and formatting. There's rarely a discussion among the cross-functional teams on use cases or scenarios for the flow of the content, which would give the user what they need when they need it.  </p><p>I use the IT professional as an example because they have a hard job. Not one company has the same IT infrastructure implemented. Plus, there's a lot on their plate with supporting different operating systems, versions of applications, security and preventing intrusions, user administration, and evaluating solutions. Because of this, I have found that writing content for them works best if it's in a scenario or goal-based format. The IT professional consults technical documentation for a reason: get answers to their questions or implement an enterprise solution end-to-end. This format results in giving them what they need when they need it.</p><p>A survey conducted by author and content strategist Rachel McConnel clearly recognized how quality content adds value. However, this same survey also recognized the adverse business impact of letting just <em>anyone</em> create the content. But at the moment, it's still a blind spot for some organizations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="ways-to-design-and-develop-better-content">Ways to design and develop better content<a href="#ways-to-design-and-develop-better-content" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ways to design and develop better content" title="Direct link to Ways to design and develop better content">​</a></h2><p>In addition to the dimensions to good technical documentation mentioned earlier, you'll want to understand the user journey by "designing the content." Content design helps you develop better content because it answers a user's need in the best way to consume it. Sarah Winters states in her book that content design is "…about using data and evidence to give the user what they need, at the time they need it and in a way they expect it."</p><p>Content design is not just writing. It's a way of thinking. It's collaborating with cross-functional teams like UX, product owners, and engineers to find the best solutions to give the user what they need when they need it and how they expect it. For example, the content could be a one-pager, a complete user guide, a training module, and so on. It could even be as small as UX/in-platform microcopy.</p><p>The basic principle here is that user needs come first, then comes the format. You're creating content that helps create a good experience for the user when using your product or service. You're helping them along their journey!</p><ul><li><p><strong>User needs come first</strong>:  Research what your user wants and needs. It can be user research, usability research, industry research, expert research, or any kind of research with data and evidence of what the user wants and needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Give them what they need when they need it</strong>: We know that giving people information too early or in the wrong place can make people leave in frustration and no longer trust you. Understanding what your user needs – when they need it – can be the difference between success and failure.</p></li><li><p><strong>In the way they expect it</strong>: Use the language your users are using. You don't use language for search engines – you use it for the humans behind those engines. You don't pull people into useless search results. Instead, you help people. Language used in a product must reflect your user's vocabulary, or they may find the interaction too difficult and eventually abandon it.</p></li></ul><p>In the end, once you have a better understanding of the user journey, you'll have a complete picture of what kind of content your user needs at each step of their journey to help them make a decision. Putting the user's needs first results in quality documentation and builds trust.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="references">References<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References" title="Direct link to References">​</a></h2><p>Winters, S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let's face it, everyone likes learning something new. Your audience is a curious bunch, no matter who they are, which is why how-to/explainer videos are perfect for any target audience. These videos are short, engaging breakdowns of broader concepts or tasks. They are also one of the most effective ways to quickly show viewers a big idea or how to do something. How-to/explainer videos must be easy to consume and to achieve this, the information delivered must be clear.</p><p>A well-produced video can undoubtedly enhance the experience for your viewers, but a well-produced video takes planning to meet a high standard of quality and clarity. Many people begin without knowing where to start or realizing the extent of the work involved. Video production is not a simple matter of recording and pressing play when you're done. It takes several hours to make a few minutes of high-quality video. A few tasks in creating a well-produced video include planning, scriptwriting, recording the video, recording and editing the voiceover, and rendering. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="what-qualities-make-a-great-how-to-video">What qualities make a great how-to video?<a href="#what-qualities-make-a-great-how-to-video" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What qualities make a great how-to video?" title="Direct link to What qualities make a great how-to video?">​</a></h2><p>As you read this article, think about your own experience as a viewer. What did you find helpful and not so helpful about the video? Was the message clear, did it flow and stick to the intended message, and did it keep you engaged throughout? Most importantly, did you get what you needed out of the video, or did it waste your time, and you didn't get much out of it?  </p><p>The following four qualities guide you from planning to writing a solid script to recording your video and selecting a voiceover professional. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="1-having-a-good-script-with-a-clear-message-matters">1. Having a good script with a clear message matters<a href="#1-having-a-good-script-with-a-clear-message-matters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Having a good script with a clear message matters" title="Direct link to 1. Having a good script with a clear message matters">​</a></h3><p>If you have a world-class product, a weak script sabotages your video, making it dull at best and confusing at worst. Always plan what you're going to say. It's easy to ramble when you record. Instead, have a plan.</p><blockquote><p>An excellent how-to video script takes work.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Define your message.</strong> Start by making a creative brief to establish the audience, goals, problems, solutions, and the proper tone. Next, you'll want to start with the actual words. This is necessary to help tailor the message. Finally, be straightforward and confident in your message. Keep these things in mind when defining your message:</p><ol><li><p>Why the video, and what's your angle? Don't make a video for the fun of it. Know your goal because you're either filling in an information gap or expanding your viewer's knowledge. HOW are you making life easier for them?</p></li><li><p>Why will the viewer care? What are their pain points? What are they trying to solve?</p></li><li><p>Anticipate the viewer's questions and make sure they get answered.</p></li><li><p>What value will this provide to the viewer?</p></li><li><p>What should the viewer take away from this video? Your conclusion should have an impact. If your video is sharp up until a shrug of a closer, all your work will be for nothing. You shouldn't end with an overtly sales-based message, but instead, there should be a final takeaway.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Communicate your brand.</strong> If you're only mentioning features in your video, then you're just playing it safe. Your viewers want to know how things impact them. Even if it's common sense, tell the viewer about how your product or idea benefits <strong>them</strong>. Consider what you'd like to hear if "you" were the customer. You're positioning the product as the "Secret Sauce" to solve or prevent the problem. After putting in the secret sauce, explain "Why" it works.</p></li><li><p><strong>Work with a professional scriptwriter.</strong> The script is the video's message; it's what you want to tell and transmit in the video.
The writer helps "engage" the right audience and makes them want to learn more (and keep on watching). The writer also helps keep the video length at just the right size; the longer the video, the more view drops it's likely to have.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="2-high-quality-video-recordings">2.

High-quality video recordings">​</a></h3><p>You can record anything and everything on your screen, but it can end up as a not-so-great viewing experience. We get that not everyone uses the same  recording software, but here are a few things to ensure consistency for the best recording quality and viewing experience:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Set up your desktop recording area and your recording software.</strong> Do not record "full screen" because it can record at a "not-so-great" aspect ratio. For example, recording at 1280x720 may seem small, but it's considered HD, plus it's the recommended size for YouTube videos.</p><p> <img loading="lazy" alt="16:9 ratio" src="/portfolio/assets/images/16-9-ratio-deb8563e49b2773a9331519d3110400a.png" width="1918" height="1080" class="img_CujE"> </p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip!</strong> You can make a 1280 x 720px placeholder image for your desktop and then re-size any browser or application within the white space before you
start to record.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Recording workflow and tips.</strong> We want a smooth transition during mouse movements and screen changes so that no further editing is needed during postproduction.</p><ol><li><p>De-clutter and clean up your desktop.</p></li><li><p>Close unused applications.</p></li><li><p>Turn off notifications and disable pop-ups.</p></li><li><p>Open the application you want to record and then do a couple of practice walkthroughs of precisely what you want to show your viewers. This helps with smooth cursor motions, and, in the end, there's more minor editing to do for the video production specialist.</p></li><li><p>When you're ready to record, start the recording and follow these tips:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Watch your mouse cursor.</strong> You'll use it to show the viewer where to follow along while explaining things. It's essential, so make sure you make it as helpful as possible.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Don't circle things.</strong> Moving your mouse around as if you're talking with your hands leaves your viewers confused and unsure of where they should look. Instead, move it deliberately and with purpose.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don't move it at the speed of light.</strong> If you're moving your mouse across the screen too fast, your audience struggles to follow along and, ultimately, stops watching.</p></li><li><p><strong>If you can, try to cut out mistakes and unneeded content</strong>. Mistakes happen to the best of us. You'll be recording, and your mouse moves to the wrong place, you click the wrong thing, or something unexpected happens. It's okay – it's fixable.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Allow 5 seconds of silence before beginning your tutorial</strong> (following along with the script). This allows a buffer, so you don't cut off anything you meant to record on the screen.</p></li><li><p><strong>As you record, speak in a conversational tone (following the script),</strong> as if you were training someone sitting next to you. Be straightforward with your language. Take your time to say WHAT you're doing and WHY you're doing it. Then, let the actions speak for themselves.</p><p>Talking as you record helps with the smooth transition and stays at a pace that you would typically see in a one-on-one training session. Plus, when you speak following along with the script, the professional voiceover can be efficiently timed with the actions. Don't worry about fumbling over your words because your audio is edited out during postproduction.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Tip!</strong> If you go off-script, but it's a valuable tidbit for the user, the voiceover professional can modify the script.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong>Allow 5 seconds of silence at the end of the recording</strong>. Here you want to make sure you don't cut anything off.</p></li></ul></li></ol></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_loeA" id="3-utilize-a-voiceover-professional">3.

Utilize a voiceover professional">​</a></h3><p>The quality of the narration makes a big difference in the overall quality of your video. Let's face it, folks, lousy narration turns off viewers faster than almost anything else. So, the importance of a clear and articulate voice in visual content is undeniable. If you want to reach a broad audience and keep them engaged, the narration must be excellent. You can ruin webinars and presentations by using the wrong voice. As a result, viewers turn their attention to the voice behind the message.</p><p>Getting and keeping your viewers' attention is why you need professional voiceovers. They are persuasive and give the right rhythm to your script. They train their voices for years and know how to make any communication exciting and easy to follow. Plus, they enjoy their jobs and smile, which can be heard in their voice and makes your video content more appealing. Professional voiceovers know how to control breath and rhythm so that the audience doesn't hear any disturbing pauses while listening.</p><p>An otherwise fantastic video is dead without the right voice to match the video's tone. Hire a professional whose sound resonates with your audience. Find someone specializing in the genre. You'd be surprised how many voiceover professionals specialize in a particular genre, such as technical or medical content. Professional voiceover is excellent, and (if you have the budget), bringing one in-house to record is always the best approach.</p><p>Your videos say a lot about your company and how you do business. And people tend to associate the quality of your content with the quality of your products or services.</p><blockquote><p>Source:
