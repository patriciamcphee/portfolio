title: Technical training
description: A voiceover script is just as important as the video itself because it sets the tone. Write the script the way we speak. Not the way we write. The audience will be hearing the words instead of reading them. This means the words need to be attention-grabbing and, most times, have a natural, conversational flow.

>**Project:**  Work-related<br />
>**Description:**  My client provided pre-recorded how-to videos with scripts to do the voice-over, but some of the scripts needed work, and the video had no audio to reference.  I needed to be resourceful, so I found the user guide, which helped, but to write a quality script, I needed to watch the video many times to add context to the actions in the video. I also edited and produced both audio (in Audacity) and video (Adobe Premiere Pro).  <br />

## Checksum Configuration

### Original
The system configuration checksum is a Nodegrid feature that creates a checksum of all the configuration files to enable a quick and easy way to find out if the Nodegrid has changed. 
To create a system configuration checksum, go to "System", then "Toolkit", and then "System Configuration Checksum". The checksum can either be MD5 or SHA256. In our example, we will create a MD5 checksum by selecting "Create a checksum of the current configuration" and click "Apply". You will then view your MD5 checksum for all the configuration files.

### Rewrite (w/final video)

The system configuration checksum is a Nodegrid feature that creates a checksum of all your configuration files.  It gives you a quick and easy way to detect changes in the Nodegrid. 

To create a system configuration checksum, go to **System>Toolkit** and then select **System Configuration Checksum**. 

The checksum can either be MD5 or SHA256.

But for our example, we'll create an MD5 checksum by selecting **Create a checksum of the current configuration** and then clicking **Apply**. 

You can see the MD5 checksum for all your configuration files.  

Now, click **Finish**.

A license is required for each managed device for Nodegrid access and control. 

The required license for each serial port of the Nodegrid is included with the product. 

Some Nodegrid features, like Clustering and Docker containers, require a license for activation. 

At the top of the Nodegrid manager, click **System**.  

Here's where all licenses enrolled in this Nodegrid displays with other information, like license key, expiration date, and application.   

To add a license, click **Add**.
