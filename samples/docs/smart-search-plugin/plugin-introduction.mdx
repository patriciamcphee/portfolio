The Smart Search Plugin for Docusaurus v3.x is a metadata-driven search solution that streamlines documentation navigation. It offers precise search capabilities through an elegant, accessible interface that works offline. 

The plugin integrates smoothly with Docusaurus projects, delivering targeted search results using metadata keywords. Its metadata-driven approach—rather than full-text indexing—provides more focused results and prevents information overload. This makes it ideal for both online and firewall-restricted environments.

## Key features

The plugin delivers an elegant search solution with these key advantages:

- Targeted search results powered by metadata keywords
- Precise content matching to minimize information overload
- **Full offline functionality** for firewall-restricted environments
- **Local testing capabilities** during development
- Modern, responsive interface with keyboard navigation

## Technical considerations

### Content processing

The plugin parses frontmatter and assigns document IDs from the frontmatter `id` field or the topic’s path filename. It processes content through an efficient three-stage system:

1. **Content collection:** Scans the /docs directory to gather markdown files and extract metadata for search functionality
2. **Content normalization:** Standardizes URLs and formats data consistently to improve navigation and SEO
3. **Index generation:** Creates optimized search indexes with smart caching for fast, accurate results in both development and production

### Automatic exclusions

The plugin automatically excludes certain content types from search indexing to maintain efficiency and relevance. These exclusions include:

- The root or main index page of your documentation
- Any documents marked as `draft: true` through the metadata flag

This selective exclusion ensures that search results remain focused and meaningful for users while optimizing the search index size.

### Search index files

The plugin generates two search index files to optimize performance across different environments. The development index supports rapid iteration during the build process, while the production index is optimized for deployment:

1. Development index: `/static/searchIndex.json` (Used during development)
2. Production index: `/build/searchIndex.json`

### Browser compatibility

The smart-search-plugin is designed to work seamlessly with all major modern web browsers including:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera
- Brave

      id="diagrams"
      src={require('../images/search-icon-only.png').default}
      alt="Image showing the search bar in its inactive state"
    />

- **Activated state with results**

    <img
      id="diagrams"
      src={require('../images/search-results.png').default}
      alt="Image showing the expanded search bar when clicked"
    />


    <img
