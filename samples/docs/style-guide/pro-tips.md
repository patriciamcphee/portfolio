Technical writing is not just about writing. It's a way of thinking.  

Focus on the customer intent - _**As a \<customer\>, I \<want to\> \<because\>**_ .  Customers have a specific purpose in mind when they consult technical documentation. Clearly determine what specific task (goal or scenario) the customer is trying to do.  Adjust the tone accordingly.

Write brief, meaningful, and focused text. Be especially clear and concise in instructions.  Lead with what matters most, so readers know immediately where to focus their attention. Be affirmative and don't waste words, avoiding unnecessary verbosity. Keep sentences short and concise.  _**Keep your content focused**_  on the scenarios or goal (the customer intent) instead of on a product and its actions. 

**User focused:** On the Replicator page, you can synchronize your local database with replica databases.

 **Product focused:** The Replicator page lets you synchronize your local database with replica databases.

When it comes to _conciseness_, think of it as presenting all the necessary information clearly and briefly, avoiding unnecessary verbosity and irrelevant information that could distract or confuse.

_**Plain language is for everyone, even experts!**_ You owe it to the readers to communicate information simply, and clearly. Remember that the primary goal of communication is to convey information. The words that you use in your copy should reflect the words people enter in the search.  Aim for a 10-12th grade reading level. Text beyond the 12th grade reading level requires too much mental effort.  Learn more about [Legibility, Readability, and Comprehension: Making Users Read Your Words](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/legibility-readability-comprehension/).

Being direct and plainspoken, using simple language is not talking down. It's clear communication, making the content easier to understand quickly.

_**Write content for brevity.**_ Long text can intimidate users, making them likely to click away or skip your content entirely, resorting to asking questions in the Webex channel. Content contributors get the advice to be _concise_, but doing so is easier said than done. 

Adopt a mindset of creating just enough documentation to be helpful, focusing on clarity and usefulness rather than exhaustive detail. This approach keeps the process lean and manageable without a dedicated technical content manager. Our goal is to help users rather than hinder or distract them with lengthy content in the form of an essay.  

In addition to the other Pro tips! mentioned, here are some other ways to help you reduce your word count, plus making your content easier to scan:

- **Bullet points and lists** — Break down complex ideas into bullet points or numbered lists. This present information into digestible pieces, making it easier for readers to find specific details.
- **Tables** — Organize data in a clear, logical layout, making complex information easier to digest quickly without diving deep into the text.  Keep them as simple as possible, focusing on the essential data to be conveyed. Avoid overly complex tables because they can be counterproductive, so balance is key.
- **Short sentences and paragraphs** — Aim for sentences that are no longer than 20 words. Keep paragraphs focused on a single idea or concept, making the document less intimidating. 
- **Clear headings and subheadings** — They act as signposts, indicating what each section covers.
- **Edit ruthlessly and eliminate redundancy** — Avoid repeating the same information. Each sentence should add something new to the document. Remove unnecessary words that don't add value to the content.
- **Key information first** — Start with the most important information. This 'inverted pyramid' style helps readers quickly grasp the key points first. Learn how to write in the [inverted pyramid style](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/).
- **Use of white space** — Adequate white space around text and between sections makes the document less cluttered and more readable. 



When writing for brevity, ask yourself: **Does the reader need this to understand me?** This question can help you in the edge cases where brevity **must be sacrificed for** **clarity.**  Oftentimes, there are things that cannot be said briefly.  That isn't an inherently bad thing!  But you can prepare for these sections by trimming the excess words in other places.

_**Enhance readability and user engagement,**_ by using an active voice, present tense, and second person ("you").  Using active voice makes the writing more lively and less wordy compared to passive constructions.  The second person point of view belongs to the person (or people) being addressed. This is the "you" perspective. 

---

**_Provide common real-life scenarios or examples_** that demonstrate how to apply the information.   Focus on the user needs, addressing their specific tasks, problems, or questions.

---

_**Use visual elements**_ _**,**_ like diagrams, charts, infographics, or images to convey information that would take up more space if explained textually.  Visuals can often communicate what words cannot, in less space.

_**Make your content easy to scan.**_  People don't read every word; instead, they scan. They naturally attempt to be efficient and put in the least possible work for achieving their goal. In a report published by [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-people-read-online/) on text scanning patterns, they found four main patterns used to scan textual information:

- **[F-pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-people-read-online/)** —In the absence of subheadings and bullets, users tend to fixate on the words toward the beginning of lines and toward the top of the page.
- **Spotted pattern**—Involves fixating on specific words or chunks of words read throughout the page.
- **[Layer Cake-pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-people-read-online/)** —Consists of fixations placed mostly on the page's headings and subheadings.
- **Commitment pattern**—Demonstrates traditional reading, not scanning. The fixation is on all or most of the words, which leads to the best comprehension, even though it is the most time consuming.

So, put the most important things first (or what might be considered the conclusion), add tables and bullet lists, use descriptive headings and subheadings, and incorporate visuals like diagrams and infographics. This writing style gets to the point quickly and supports all types of readers.

_**Keep the number of notes, cautions, and tips to a minimum and use sparingly.**_   Keep these elements concise and to the point to avoid overwhelming the reader. Also, ensure that each note, caution, or tip is directly relevant to the surrounding content.

Just like in a cooking recipe, the placement of notes, cautions, and tips should be guided by their relevance to the specific part of the content they support. For example, if a note is about a specific step, it should be placed right there, not at the end or in a separate section. This ensures that the user has all the relevant information at the moment it's needed, much like how a baker needs substitution info right when they're measuring the ingredients rather than at the end of the recipe.
