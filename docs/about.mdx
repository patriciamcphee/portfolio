- Graphic and visual design (newsletters, brochures, and eBooks)
- Full stack and responsive web development (React/Node.js)
- Scenario-based technical content development for IT professionals (computer networking and identity management)
- Innovating, collaborating with colleagues, and expanding my skills



## How I became a UX Technical Writer
<!-- Include file -->
I'm a self-driven Sr. UX Technical Writer and Content Designer. I've been in IT for 25 years, starting in support and moving to network system administration. However, for the past 20 years, I've been a Technical Writer taking the guesswork out of complex technical content. I started my technical writing career on the Human Factors (Human-Centered Design & Engineering) team at a large telecommunications company. There, I learned how conduct usability tests to uncover and solve user experience (UX) challenges early in my career. 

Over the last 12 years, I've implemented custom authoring environments with MadCap Flare and docs-as-code frameworks, to help organizations reduce, simplify, and restructure their content, ensuring quality and accuracy, increasing customer satisfaction rates.

## Where I'm going next in my career

About 12 years ago, I started to explore different careers like Medical Writer, Voiceover/Voice Actor ([listen to my demos](https://soundcloud.com/patriciamcphee/sets/voiceover-demos)), or returning to my roots as a Graphic Designer. I even considered becoming a UX/UI Designer, Instructional Designer, or Web Developer. However, after exploring these possibilities, I decided to learn Full Stack Web Development first and then get certified in UX Design.  

During all of my exploring, I discovered that I really enjoy developing content management systems using static-site generators like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) docs-as-code frameworks. In the past, I've built technical content management systems from scratch using MadCap Flare or Robohelp, but I fell in love with open-source platforms. So next, I want to try implementing the [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx_getting_started.html) docs-as-code framework.

Fast-forward to today, this is where [CareerFoundy](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/) comes into the picture. I'm currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development program. My goal is to bring my programming skills up to par and graduate by September 2022. After that, I'll reach for and grab a UX Design certificate by March 2023 to transition into a UX Content Designer role.
