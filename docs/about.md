I'm a highly skilled Senior Technical Writer passionate about optimizing user experiences. Writing is just the tip of the iceberg; I'm also a strategist. I create product documentation that users can navigate effortlessly and believe in the power of clear, intuitive user experiences, incorporating this belief into every project.

Over the years, I've showcased my skills in content development, from thorough content audits to mastering tools like Docusaurus and MadCap Flare. Whether I'm refining content for budding tech startups or enhancing platforms for industry titans like Microsoft or GE Healthcare, I prioritize a user-centric approach.

I'm a firm believer that impactful content is born from teamwork. My rich experience, from partnering with Oculus's VR experts to Microsoft's Azure and networking professionals, ensures the documentation is comprehensive and resonates with both tech experts and end-users.

The tech realm is ever-evolving, and so am I. I bring more than two decades of technical writing experience to the table, but I'm also committed to continuous growth and adaptation. Presently, I'm immersing myself in Conversation Design.
