title: Voiceover scripts
description: A voiceover script is just as important as the video itself because it sets the tone. Write the script the way we speak. Not the way we write. The audience will be hearing the words instead of reading them. This means the words need to be attention-grabbing and, most times, have a natural, conversational flow.
