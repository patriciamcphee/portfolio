When I write how-to's, I use the [minimalism](https://www.technicallywriteit.com/the-art-of-saying-less-minimalism/) approach. How-to's are easy-to-follow, action-oriented instructions that explain step-by-step how to perform a task or use a specific feature in an app. Instructions are the way you do things. For example, making cookies includes the ingredients, mixing the ingredients, and how and at what temperature you should make them.
