User interface text, or UI strings, appears on UI surfaces. This text includes control labels and static text:

- Control labels identify controls and are placed directly on or next to the controls.

- Static text is not part of interactive control and provides users with detailed instructions or explanations to make informed decisions. Take the Azure portal, for example. Azure does an excellent job providing static text that offers helpful guidance. In addition, it often has a **Learn more** link to the user documentation.

## Design concepts

Software developers often think of text as relegated to product documentation and technical support. "First, we'll write the code, and then we'll hire someone to help us explain what we have developed." Yet, in reality, the important text is written earlier in the process, as the UI is conceived and coded. This text is, after all, seen more frequently and by more people than perhaps any other type of technical writing.

Comprehensible text is crucial to effective UI. Professional writers and editors should work with software developers on UI text as an integral part of the design process. Have them work on text early because text problems often reveal design problems. If your team has trouble explaining a design, it is often the design, not the explanation, that needs improving.

## Design considerations UI text

Consider these facts when you think about the UI text and its placement in the UI:
- During focused, immersive reading, people read in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order (in Western cultures).
- Users aren't immersed in the UI itself but their work when using the software. 
- Users don't read UI text; **they scan it**. When scanning, users may appear to be reading text when they are filtering it in reality. They often don't truly comprehend the UI text unless they perceive the need.
- Within a window, different UI elements receive different levels of attention. Users tend to read control labels first, especially those that appear relevant to completing the task at hand. By contrast, users tend to read static text only when they think they need to.

You should also assume that once users have decided what to do, they will immediately stop reading and do it.
