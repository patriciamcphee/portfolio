I'm a self-driven Sr. UX Technical Writer and Content Designer. I've been in IT for 25 years, starting in support and moving to network system administration. My expertise is in taking the guesswork out of complex technical content for busy IT professionals. 

Over the last ten years, I've helped organizations reduce, simplify, and restructure their content, ensuring quality and accuracy increasing customer satisfaction rates.


## Accomplishments 

- Built an online help system using the Docusaurus docs-as-code framework for a tech security startup.
- Wrote shell scripts to automate OpenAPI content publishing for Extreme Networks.
- Streamlined a weekly team status report for the Amazon executive team, reducing the time to compile and deliver the information by ~4 hours (more than half).
- Rewrote a decades-old installation and upgrade guide for the GE Healthcare electronic medical records customers and support team, reducing the time to install or upgrade, data loss or corruption, and support calls.
- Built a _**custom**_ authoring environment in MadCap Flare and converted legacy content for several large corporations, maximizing content reuse and to reducing the cost of creating, managing, and publishing content.
