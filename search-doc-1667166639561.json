In the research and gathering phase of the project, you're finding out what the users need, what they want, and what they know. You're also learning about the content, what exists, what doesn't, and what is possible. Don't forget to observe user behavior and what questions they ask because these two are essential to the IA design. When I put myself into a &quot;Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom&quot; mindset, I will watch users in their natural habitat when they reach a pain point. What do they do? Do they go to the documentation, and if so, how long do they spend before they give up? If they don't go to the official documentation, are they seeking out blogs or forums to get their answers? Directly asking them might not give you much because of their &quot;muscle memory.&quot; Once you've researched and learned about the user, the Information Architect (Content Designer in this case) designs the solutions with an IA structure to the defined problems and goals. At this point, testing ensures the navigation works for the specified goals. If new content needs to be prepared, this is the time to start. Without research into people and content, you won't be able to make good information architecture design decisions.

Always plan what you're going to say. It's easy to ramble when you record. Instead, have a plan. An excellent how-to video script takes work. Define your message. Start by making a creative brief to establish the audience, goals, problems, solutions, and the proper tone. Next, you'll want to start with the actual words. This is necessary to help tailor the message. Finally, be straightforward and confident in your message. Keep these things in mind when defining your message: Why the video, and what's your angle? Don't make a video for the fun of it. Know your goal because you're either filling in an information gap or expanding your viewer's knowledge. HOW are you making life easier for them? Why will the viewer care? What are their pain points? What are they trying to solve? Anticipate the viewer's questions and make sure they get answered. What value will this provide to the viewer? What should the viewer take away from this video? Your conclusion should have an impact. If your video is sharp up until a shrug of a closer, all your work will be for nothing. You shouldn't end with an overtly sales-based message, but instead, there should be a final takeaway. Communicate your brand. If you're only mentioning features in your video, then you're just playing it safe. Your viewers want to know how things impact them. Even if it's common sense, tell the viewer about how your product or idea benefits them. Consider what you'd like to hear if &quot;you&quot; were the customer. You're positioning the product as the &quot;Secret Sauce&quot; to solve or prevent the problem. After putting in the secret sauce, explain &quot;Why&quot; it works. Work with a professional scriptwriter. The script is the video's message; it's what you want to tell and transmit in the video. The writer helps &quot;engage&quot; the right audience and makes them want to learn more (and keep on watching). The writer also helps keep the video length at just the right size; the longer the video, the more view drops it's likely to have. "},{"title":"2.

We get that not everyone uses the same recording software, but here are a few things to ensure consistency for the best recording quality and viewing experience: Set up your desktop recording area and your recording software. Do not record &quot;full screen&quot; because it can record at a &quot;not-so-great&quot; aspect ratio. For example, recording at 1280x720 may seem small, but it's considered HD, plus it's the recommended size for YouTube videos. Tip! You can make a 1280 x 720px placeholder image for your desktop and then re-size any browser or application within the white space before you start to record. Recording workflow and tips. We want a smooth transition during mouse movements and screen changes so that no further editing is needed during postproduction. De-clutter and clean up your desktop. Close unused applications. Turn off notifications and disable pop-ups. Open the application you want to record and then do a couple of practice walkthroughs of precisely what you want to show your viewers. This helps with smooth cursor motions, and, in the end, there's more minor editing to do for the video production specialist. When you're ready to record, start the recording and follow these tips: Watch your mouse cursor. You'll use it to show the viewer where to follow along while explaining things. It's essential, so make sure you make it as helpful as possible. Don't circle things. Moving your mouse around as if you're talking with your hands leaves your viewers confused and unsure of where they should look. Instead, move it deliberately and with purpose. Don't move it at the speed of light. If you're moving your mouse across the screen too fast, your audience struggles to follow along and, ultimately, stops watching. If you can, try to cut out mistakes and unneeded content. Mistakes happen to the best of us. You'll be recording, and your mouse moves to the wrong place, you click the wrong thing, or something unexpected happens. It's okay – it's fixable. Allow 5 seconds of silence before beginning your tutorial (following along with the script). This allows a buffer, so you don't cut off anything you meant to record on the screen. As you record, speak in a conversational tone (following the script), as if you were training someone sitting next to you. Be straightforward with your language. Take your time to say WHAT you're doing and WHY you're doing it. Then, let the actions speak for themselves. Talking as you record helps with the smooth transition and stays at a pace that you would typically see in a one-on-one training session. Plus, when you speak following along with the script, the professional voiceover can be efficiently timed with the actions. Don't worry about fumbling over your words because your audio is edited out during postproduction. Tip! If you go off-script, but it's a valuable tidbit for the user, the voiceover professional can modify the script. Allow 5 seconds of silence at the end of the recording. Here you want to make sure you don't cut anything off. "},{"title":"3.

Let's face it, folks, lousy narration turns off viewers faster than almost anything else. So, the importance of a clear and articulate voice in visual content is undeniable. If you want to reach a broad audience and keep them engaged, the narration must be excellent. You can ruin webinars and presentations by using the wrong voice. As a result, viewers turn their attention to the voice behind the message. Getting and keeping your viewers' attention is why you need professional voiceovers. They are persuasive and give the right rhythm to your script. They train their voices for years and know how to make any communication exciting and easy to follow. Plus, they enjoy their jobs and smile, which can be heard in their voice and makes your video content more appealing. Professional voiceovers know how to control breath and rhythm so that the audience doesn't hear any disturbing pauses while listening. An otherwise fantastic video is dead without the right voice to match the video's tone. Hire a professional whose sound resonates with your audience. Find someone specializing in the genre. You'd be surprised how many voiceover professionals specialize in a particular genre, such as technical or medical content. Professional voiceover is excellent, and (if you have the budget), bringing one in-house to record is always the best approach. Your videos say a lot about your company and how you do business. And people tend to associate the quality of your content with the quality of your products or services.

People often think that single sourcing means that the online help and user manuals must be identical in terms of content. This is an incorrect assumption. Single sourcing is creating a single content source then producing different types of documentation from it. Single sourcing considers the differing needs of the audience and the strengths and weaknesses of each of your output media (Darley, p. 3). In a nutshell, single sourcing is just a development strategy that enables writers to develop centralized information modules then map them to distinct audiences, media, or both without recreating the content for the other document formats. For example, you can map the content to your online help, website, marking material, user's guides, and training manuals with single sourcing. Another advantage to single sourcing is that the other document formats (i.e., online help and printed media) are automatically updated when you update the information module. For technical writers, single sourcing means modular writing and information mapping. For example, rather than developing information for a given format, such as a user's guide or online help, writers develop information modules at the element level (i.e., section, paragraph, and sentence). The information modules get mapped to preselected audiences and media. References:​ Darley, J. (12 January 2003). Single Sourcing - An Introduction.

The top problem I've observed is that the user is misunderstood—that is, the overall user journey is overlooked. For example, IT professionals are often misunderstood, so their content doesn't directly speak to them. What do I mean by this? Most often, the content is written by a very technical person, and then it's handed off for editing and formatting. There's rarely a discussion among the cross-functional teams on use cases or scenarios for the flow of the content, which would give the user what they need when they need it. I use the IT professional as an example because they have a hard job. Not one company has the same IT infrastructure implemented. Plus, there's a lot on their plate with supporting different operating systems, versions of applications, security and preventing intrusions, user administration, and evaluating solutions. Because of this, I have found that writing content for them works best if it's in a scenario or goal-based format. The IT professional consults technical documentation for a reason: get answers to their questions or implement an enterprise solution end-to-end. This format results in giving them what they need when they need it. A survey conducted by author and content strategist Rachel McConnel clearly recognized how quality content adds value. However, this same survey also recognized the adverse business impact of letting just anyone create the content. But at the moment, it's still a blind spot for some organizations.

Sarah Winters states in her book that content design is &quot;…about using data and evidence to give the user what they need, at the time they need it and in a way they expect it.&quot; Content design is not just writing. It's a way of thinking. It's collaborating with cross-functional teams like UX, product owners, and engineers to find the best solutions to give the user what they need when they need it and how they expect it. For example, the content could be a one-pager, a complete user guide, a training module, and so on. It could even be as small as UX/in-platform microcopy. The basic principle here is that user needs come first, then comes the format. You're creating content that helps create a good experience for the user when using your product or service. You're helping them along their journey! User needs come first: Research what your user wants and needs. It can be user research, usability research, industry research, expert research, or any kind of research with data and evidence of what the user wants and needs. Give them what they need when they need it: We know that giving people information too early or in the wrong place can make people leave in frustration and no longer trust you. Understanding what your user needs – when they need it – can be the difference between success and failure. In the way they expect it: Use the language your users are using. You don't use language for search engines – you use it for the humans behind those engines. You don't pull people into useless search results. Instead, you help people. Language used in a product must reflect your user's vocabulary, or they may find the interaction too difficult and eventually abandon it. In the end, once you have a better understanding of the user journey, you'll have a complete picture of what kind of content your user needs at each step of their journey to help them make a decision. Putting the user's needs first results in quality documentation and builds trust.

Over the past two decades, I've worked in technical writing, helping organizations reduce, simplify, and restructure their digital end-user documentation, ensuring quality and accuracy, and increasing customer satisfaction rates. Before content design/technical writing, I was a graphic designer specializing in page layout and design (desktop publishing for textbooks, user manuals, magazines, and newsletters). This has helped me quickly understand the fundamentals and concepts of UX Design for the digital world, especially for end-user documentation. After graphic design and before content design/technical writing, I worked in technical support and network system administration for about five years. I also have a Computer Science degree through DeVry and Full Stack Web Development (MongoDB, Express, React, Node (MERN)) training through various freelance projects and CareerFoundry. I love docs-as-code frameworks for universal documentation sites and Information Architecture. I've built online help systems or doc sites using various frameworks and purposes for the past 20+ years. Early in my career, I helped run usability tests for &quot;online&quot; technical content, like knowledge bases.

On the consumer side, they see an empty message with no content. For authenticated users, backgrounding the app while loading the photo does not get interrupted. Consumers must tap the photo again with each visit for unauthenticated sessions because the history gets cleared when a session expires or logs the consumer out.
