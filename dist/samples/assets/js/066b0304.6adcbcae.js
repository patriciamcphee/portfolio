Yet, modern search systems often overwhelm users with irrelevant results, straying far from their original purpose of helping users find information quickly and accurately. The **Smart Search Plugin** for **Docusaurus 3.x** reintroduces a concept that worked effectively decades ago in online help systems\u2014**metadata keywords**\u2014to deliver targeted, efficient, and intuitive search functionality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nThis plugin brings back simplicity and precision by leveraging **metadata keywords**. It works seamlessly **offline** and supports **firewall-restricted environments**. Eliminating the need for external APIs and allowing local testing simplifies development workflows and ensures a robust search experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## The evolution of search: Lessons from metadata-driven systems\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty years ago, XML-based authoring tools relied on metadata keywords to power search in online help systems and create document indices. This approach targeted user queries with precision, delivering highly relevant results by matching specific keywords. For example, users searching for \\"password reset\\" would only see results directly related to that topic, avoiding an overload of tangentially related content.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhere along the way, this simplicity was replaced by overly complex systems that attempt to guess user intent by indexing entire documents. While this might sound advanced, it often leads to **information overload**. As the Nielsen Norman Group highlights, users faced with irrelevant or excessive search results often feel frustrated, losing confidence in the system\'s ability to provide helpful answers ([Nielsen Norman Group, 2024](https://media.nngroup.com/media/reports/free/iPad_App_and_Website_Usability_2nd_Edition.pdf)).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe **Smart Search Plugin** returns to the proven principles of metadata-driven search, ensuring results are as focused and relevant as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why metadata keywords matter\\r\\n\\r\\nMetadata keywords provide a bridge between how users think about their search terms and how the system retrieves results. Unlike generalized search algorithms that index every word in a document, metadata keywords focus on **curated, intentional tags** that reflect the language users are likely to use.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Benefits of metadata-driven search\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Targeted Results**: Only content tagged with relevant metadata appears, reducing irrelevant results.\\r\\n- **Intuitive Experience**: Users get results that match what they \\"think\\" their query will yield.\\r\\n- **Search Accuracy**: Limits noise by excluding unrelated terms that might appear in a full-text search.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, if a user searches \\"API token,\\" the plugin will prioritize results explicitly tagged with those terms, avoiding results that merely mention \\"API\\" or \\"token\\" incidentally.\\r\\n\\r\\n### How the Smart Search Plugin works\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Smart Search Plugin leverages metadata keywords defined in the front matter of individual topics. These keywords align closely with user expectations, enabling targeted and precise search functionality. The plugin is configured in the `docusaurus.config.js` file to recognize and use these metadata fields, ensuring a seamless integration into your Docusaurus project.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key advantages\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Metadata utilization** - Search results are generated based on metadata keywords assigned directly to each document. This ensures that only the most relevant results are displayed, reducing irrelevant search noise.\\r\\n2. **Local and offline testing** - Developers can test and refine search functionality during local development without needing to deploy the site to a production environment. This saves time and aligns with agile workflows.\\r\\n3. **No external APIs** - The plugin operates entirely within your Docusaurus environment, eliminating the need for external API dependencies and ensuring security behind firewalls.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration example\\r\\n\\r\\nTo enable the plugin, add and configure it in your `docusaurus.config.js` file. The configuration instructs the plugin to look for the `keywords` field in the metadata of each topic.\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n  const path = require(\'path\');\\r\\n\\r\\n  staticDirectories: [\'static\'], // Required for search index\\r\\n\\r\\n  plugins: [\\r\\n    path.resolve(__dirname, \'node_modules/smart-search-plugin\')\\r\\n  ],\\r\\n\\r\\n  presets: [\\r\\n    [\\r\\n      \'smart-search-plugin\',\\r\\n      {\\r\\n        // Optional configuration\\r\\n        excludedFolders: [\'contributor-guide\', \'includes\', \'_includes\'],\\r\\n        excludedPrefixes: [\'_\'],\\r\\n        searchWeights: {\\r\\n          title: 1.0,\\r\\n          \'sections.heading\': 1.0,\\r\\n          keywords: 0.8,\\r\\n          description: 0.6,\\r\\n          \'sections.content\': 0.5,\\r\\n          content: 0.4\\r\\n        }\\r\\n      }\\r\\n    ],\\r\\n  ],\\r\\n\\r\\n  themeConfig: {\\r\\n      navbar: {\\r\\n      items: [\\r\\n        {\\r\\n          type: \'search\',\\r\\n          position: \'right\',\\r\\n        },\\r\\n      ],\\r\\n    },\\r\\n  },\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Search Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\'s how the Smart Search Plugin appears in your Docusaurus navbar:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Inactive state**\\r\\n   \\r\\n   ![Image showing the search bar in its inactive state](./images/search-icon-only.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Activated state with results**\\r\\n\\r\\n    <img\\r\\n      id=\\"diagrams\\"\\r\\n      src={require(\'./images/search-results.png\').default}\\r\\n      alt=\\"Image showing the expanded search bar when clicked\\"\\r\\n    />\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe search functionality seamlessly integrates with your Docusaurus theme while maintaining the metadata-driven approach described above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Example metadata in markdown files\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keywords are defined in the front matter of individual markdown files in two types of arrays.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this setup, the plugin scans the `keywords` field in each document\'s metadata to generate precise search results tailored to user expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Inline array\\r\\n\\r\\n```markdown\\r\\n---\\r\\nid: getting-started\\r\\ntitle: Getting Started\\r\\nkeywords: [introduction, getting started, beginner guide]\\r\\n---\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n- **What it is**: This is an **inline array** or **compact array**.\\r\\n- **Characteristics**:\\r\\n    - All array elements are enclosed within square brackets `[ ]`.\\r\\n    - Elements are separated by commas `,`.\\r\\n    - The entire array is written on a single line.\\r\\n- **Best used for**:\\r\\n    - Short arrays with a small number of elements.\\r\\n    - Situations where readability and brevity are important.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Block array\\r\\n\\r\\n```markdown\\r\\n---\\r\\nid: getting-started\\r\\ntitle: Getting Started\\r\\nkeywords:\\r\\n  - introduction\\r\\n  - getting started\\r\\n  - beginner guide\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n- **What it is**: This is a **block array** or **multiline array**.\\r\\n- **Characteristics**:\\r\\n    - Each array element is listed on a separate line.\\r\\n    - Each element is preceded by a hyphen `` and a space.\\r\\n    - Typically used for longer arrays or when each element is complex (e.g., includes nested data or longer strings).\\r\\n- **Best used for**:\\r\\n    - Arrays with many elements.\\r\\n    - Scenarios where individual elements need extra clarity or comments.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key differences\\r\\n\\r\\n| **Aspect** | **Inline Array** | **Block Array** |\\r\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\r\\n| **Syntax** | Enclosed in square brackets `[ ]` | Each element starts with `-` on a new line |\\r\\n| **Readability** | Compact, concise | Better for longer or more detailed lists |\\r\\n| **Use Case** | Small arrays, simple data | Larger arrays, nested or complex data |\\r\\n| **Preferred Style** | Personal or team preference | Often used in YAML for better clarity |\\r\\n\\r\\n### Which to use?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Inline arrays** are great for short, simple lists where all the information fits comfortably on one line.\\r\\n- **Block arrays** are preferable for longer, more complex lists or when working in contexts that favor YAML readability and maintainability.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth are valid YAML syntax, and the choice often depends on personal or team style preferences and the complexity of the data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Features: Built for simplicity and precision\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Works behind a firewall** - Unlike search-as-a-service tools like Algolia or Typesense, the plugin works entirely offline, making it ideal for secure environments where external API calls are not permitted.\\r\\n2. **Offline testing** - Test search functionality during development without publishing your site. This saves time and allows for agile iterations.\\r\\n3. **Precision through metadata** - By focusing on metadata keywords, the plugin ensures users find what they need, avoiding the pitfalls of broad, full-text indexing.\\r\\n4. **Ease of use** - A simple, API-free setup with no complex configurations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## A case for metadata-driven search\\r\\n\\r\\nMetadata keyword functionality echoes the simplicity and effectiveness of **indexing in XML-based authoring tools** used two decades ago. These systems empowered technical writers to curate terms users carefully were likely to search for, creating intuitive and efficient online help experiences. Returning to this proven approach, the Smart Search Plugin avoids the pitfalls of modern systems that overcomplicate search with bloated algorithms.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies confirm that overly broad search strategies are a major contributor to poor user experience. For example:\\r\\n\\r\\n- In systematic reviews, inefficient searches often fail to retrieve relevant information, creating incomplete or biased results ([Systematic Reviews Journal, 2024](https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-016-0371-9)).\\r\\n- Users report frustration when faced with excessive irrelevant results, as noted in usability studies ([Nielsen Norman Group, 2024](https://media.nngroup.com/media/reports/free/iPad_App_and_Website_Usability_2nd_Edition.pdf)).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Smart Search Plugin eliminates these inefficiencies by focusing exclusively on metadata keywords, ensuring relevant, precise, and aligned results with user intent.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nThe **Smart Search Plugin** redefines search for Docusaurus-based projects by combining modern technology with time-tested principles of metadata-driven search. Its ability to work offline, behind firewalls, and without external APIs makes it an unparalleled solution for secure and efficient documentation searches.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy focusing on metadata keywords, the plugin restores simplicity and precision to search functionality, empowering users to find what they need confidently and easily. If you\'re ready to transform how users interact with your documentation, the Smart Search Plugin is the way forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## References\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

They\'re not just change logs but narratives documenting a product\'s evolution, playing an essential role in user engagement and product management strategy.\\r\\n\\r\\nExplore the sections below, which elucidate these guidelines and furnish examples designed to assist you in composing more potent release notes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\'s New\\r\\n\\r\\nUtilize this section for newly added features that did not exist before the release. If a feature exists but has been improved, include it in the \\"Improved\\" section instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor \\"What\'s New\\" items, initiate with phrases like, \\"You can now do XYZ\u2026\\" or \\"XYZ is now available\u2026\\" and elucidate the benefit of the feature. For instance, \\"XYZ feature is now available, letting you [to perform this action because of this benefit].\\" \\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip \\"What\'s Coming!\\"\\r\\nYou can also follow the guidelines as **What\'s New** to showcase upcoming features. Remember, infuse excitement and fun into the narrative to engage your users.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Examples\\r\\n\\r\\n- Console users can now view each user\'s **Enrollment Status**.\\r\\n- Optimization in cloud services is available, enhancing processing speed.\\r\\n- Support for managed automatic updates is now available for Windows and macOS, leveraging version control settings to manage update settings.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Guidelines\\r\\n\\r\\n- Maintain a customer-centric approach\\r\\n- Utilize the present tense\\r\\n- Ensure clarity and completeness in sentences\\r\\n- Integrate visuals to explain new features\\r\\n\\r\\nAvoid using merely the Jira ticket title, as it lacks context for readers.\\r\\n\\r\\n| **Don\'t**  |\\r\\n|--- |\\r\\n| Drill through from Deployment Snapshot to User Grid |\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, provide clear and concise details of the added feature and its utility for the user.\\r\\n\\r\\n| **Do**  |\\r\\n|---|\\r\\n| Console administrators can now select **Deployment Snapshot** metrics and drill down through to pre-filtered lists of the user grid representing those metrics. For example, they can click on the pending enrollment total, prompting them to navigate to the user grid pre-filtered to those users\' pending enrollment. |\\r\\n\\r\\n## Improved\\r\\n\\r\\nThis section highlights features that have undergone improvements, excluding new, known issues or bug-related updates.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen elucidating updated or enhanced features, initiate with phrases such as, \\"We\'ve refined...\\" or \\"XYZ has been enhanced...\\" followed by the rationale behind the improvement. For example, was the UI redesigned to bolster functionality? If so, supplement your explanation with visuals and comprehensive information to ensure the reader grasps the nature and impact of the improvement or update.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Examples\\r\\n\\r\\n- Visual updates to the **Activity Snapshot** were made to improve metrics\' usability and clarity. Also, more detail was added regarding the date ranges compared.\\r\\n- Improved the response from fingerprint readers after sleep or wake events. If there\'s an issue after applying this update, consider updating the fingerprint reader\'s driver to the most up-to-date manufacturer driver version. In some cases, the Windows Universal driver works best.\\r\\n- The **Last Seen** column was added in the user profile section under the **Devices** tab to be more consistent across the console.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Guidelines\\r\\n\\r\\n- Keep it customer-centric\\r\\n- Write in the present tense\\r\\n- Use complete sentences\\r\\n- Explain changes with visuals\\r\\n\\r\\nAvoid using just the Jira ticket title. For readers, there needs to be more context around why we updated something.\\r\\n\\r\\n| **Don\'t** |\\r\\n|---|\\r\\n| Verify Last Authenticated time is correct & consistent between user\'s table and user device |\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, provide the details and reason for the change or update.\\r\\n\\r\\n| **Do**  |\\r\\n|---|\\r\\n| Updated the **Last Seen** column name in the user profile section under the **Devices** tab to **Last Authentication** to be more consistent across the console. |\\r\\n\\r\\n## Resolved\\r\\n\\r\\nNavigating the delicate balance between offering sufficient detail and avoiding an inundation of perplexing text blocks is crucial. There\'s no need to expose all the intricacies, yet finding a middle ground is imperative.\\r\\n\\r\\nUtilize this section to detail bug fixes, ensuring each item succinctly describes the observed behavior (the issue) and, where possible, integrates the anticipated behavior. This may only sometimes be feasible, as illustrated in the examples below.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen addressing resolved or fixed items, the choice of verbs is pivotal. For instance, employing *improved* for an item subtly implies it pertains to an enhancement or improvement to a feature rather than a bug. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Examples\\r\\n\\r\\n- An error would display after navigating to a user\'s device from the Admin Console.\\r\\n- When prompted to set up security (PIN, password, swipe, etc.) on Android, a passkey wouldn\'t export.\\r\\n- When enabling the **Login Hint Validation Config** toggle, the OIDC Login Hint Strategies required message didn\'t display.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Guidelines\\r\\n\\r\\n- Add context around the observed behavior\\r\\n- Write in the past tense\\r\\n- Use complete sentences\\r\\n\\r\\nAvoid using just the Jira ticket title. For readers, this needs more context around what was happening.\\r\\n\\r\\n| **Don\'t** |\\r\\n|---|\\r\\n| Fix issue with icons resetting to default imageDesktop Login |\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, provide the observed behavior (the issue) in the past tense. Try incorporating the expected behavior if possible, but sometimes it\'s impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\n| **Do**  |\\r\\n|---|\\r\\n| Some security images were reset to the default icon image when retrieving credentials on a Windows computer. |\\r\\n\\r\\n## Known issues\\r\\n\\r\\nUtilize this section to transparently address known issues that may influence the user and their overall experience. For instance, should there be a recognized limitation with a particular browser, such as Safari, it is imperative to detail the specifics of this limitation. When a workaround is available, this section becomes pivotal for delineating those details. This informs the customer of our awareness of the issue (or limitation, in this context) and communicates proactivity and transparency.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the issue is resolved, crafting the content that allows for a seamless transition from present to past tense can also streamline the writing process for future release notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s not about airing the proverbial dirty laundry, but rather, it\'s about finding a harmonious balance in communication. Strive to provide sufficient detail without inundating users with extensive, perplexing text blocks. The goal is to convey essential information clearly, concisely, and user-friendly, ensuring that users are well-informed without feeling overwhelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Guidelines\\r\\n\\r\\n- Add context around the known issue\\r\\n- Write in the present tense\\r\\n- Use complete sentences\\r\\n- Keep it customer-centric\\r\\n- Give them a workaround if possible\\r\\n\\r\\nAvoid using just the Jira ticket title. For readers, this needs more context around what was happening.\\r\\n\\r\\n| **Don\'t** |\\r\\n|---|\\r\\n| See the \\"Windows Failure\\" support article. |\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, provide the details of the known issue in the present tense and, if possible, the workaround.\\r\\n\\r\\n| **Do**  |\\r\\n|---|\\r\\n| We are investigating a Windows failure. For more details and a workaround, see our [knowledgebase article](https://support.domain.com/hc/en-us/articles/1234567890123). |\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the dynamic world of product development, release notes are a pivotal communication tool between your team and your users. They illuminate the pathway your product is treading and serve as a transparent medium, showcasing your commitment to continuous improvement and user-centric design. Crafting them with clarity, precision, and a dash of enthusiasm can transform a mundane update into an exciting revelation of your product\'s journey and future.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember, your release notes are a reflection of your product\'s evolution.
