Application programming interfaces (APIs) provide a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It's a software interface offering a service to other pieces of software. A document that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.

As for the information architecture of API documentation, the jury is still out.  I've seen and been a part of many API documentation projects. Each had a different way of presenting the information (the format). With that said, I am not sure which format works best for the developer. Which format is easier to navigate? Which format has a distracting format (lots happening on the page and too much to consume)? These are questions I'd ask a set of different app developers.
