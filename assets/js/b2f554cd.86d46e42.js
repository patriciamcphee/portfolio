The Feature Writing Canvas provides a structured approach, including identifying beneficiaries, creating a benefit hypothesis, and setting acceptance criteria. This ensures that features fulfill their purpose and deliver value to both the business and end users. Emphasizing user engagement and hypothesis validation, this approach streamlines prioritization, implementation, and testing for product success.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Elevate the Value of Your Features\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the [Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/features-and-capabilities/), a feature is defined as \\"a service that fulfills a stakeholder\'s need.\\" Integral to this definition are a benefit hypothesis and acceptance criteria, both tailored for delivery by a single Agile Release Train within a Program Increment. However, merely defining a feature isn\'t enough. How it is described is equally crucial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe software industry embraces the principle: \\"[garbage in, garbage out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out).\\" This underscores the idea that the input\'s quality, in this case, the feature description, profoundly affects the output or end result. A loosely defined feature could jeopardize its value, affecting both internal stakeholders and end users. Recognizing this need for precision, companies like [Creaholic](https://creaholic.com/) have partnered with [Swisscom](https://www.swisscom.ch/) to enhance feature definitions and thereby boost end-user value.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Crafting Features with Precision\\r\\n\\r\\nNavigating the intricate landscape of feature development requires more than a basic understanding of what a feature should do. This section delves into the [Feature Writing Canvas](https://productmanagertools.io/feature-writing-canvas.html) and the  structured approach to crafting high-quality features. From identifying the specific beneficiaries to laying down an insightful benefit hypothesis and setting measurable acceptance criteria, this canvas acts as a roadmap for product managers and development teams. The aim is to ensure that every feature fulfills its intended purpose and delivers measurable value to both the business and the end users. Through a blend of examples and best practices, this section guides you to translate abstract ideas into features that resonate with precision and impact.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/feature-writing-template.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\n### 1. Beneficiaries: Centering the User\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foundation of a high-quality feature is understanding its intended users or stakeholders. Who are they? What are their needs? Especially in expansive IT projects, engaging directly with end users is pivotal. This direct communication not only captures their requirements but also enriches your understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Good Example**: \\"Our feature is designed for both administrators and regular users.\\"  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Bad Example**: \\"Some people might like our feature.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. Benefit Hypothesis: Pinpointing the Advantage\\r\\n\\r\\nThe canvas\'s second segment emphasizes the benefit hypothesis, which follows this structure: \\r\\n\\r\\n> If (proposition), then (benefit)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the proposition lays out the feature\'s purpose, the benefit elucidates its anticipated impact. These benefits could span across various areas: from heightened efficiency and cost-cutting to boosting user satisfaction. It\'s imperative for product managers to scrutinize and validate these hypotheses perpetually.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Good Example**: \\"If we introduce a one-click checkout feature, then we anticipate enhanced user satisfaction and a surge in sales.\\"  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Bad Example**: \\"Changing a few things might be good.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3. Acceptance Criteria: Setting the Gold Standard\\r\\n\\r\\nAcceptance criteria function as the yardstick against which a feature\'s success is measured. As per the SAFe, they \\"alleviate implementation risks and provide an avenue for the early validation of the benefit hypothesis.\\" They should not be misconstrued as mere to-do lists or blueprints but as vivid depictions of the system once the feature has been integrated.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Good Example**: \\"The one-click checkout should diminish the average checkout duration by a minimum of 30%.\\"  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Bad Example**: \\"It should work faster.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n![](./images/the-feature-writing-canvas.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Navigating Towards Feature Excellence\\r\\n\\r\\nEmbracing a uniform writing format is pivotal for elevating feature quality. This approach mirrors the paradigm shift in story-writing where certain formats are now revered as the gold standard. The ultimate secret, however, lies in galvanizing product managers to deeply connect with their users. This transition from traditional to agile methodologies places paramount importance on user engagement and hypothesis validation.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven that feature implementation demands significant resources, understanding its core proposition and potential benefits becomes indispensable. This clarity aids in streamlining prioritization, implementation, and testing, ultimately laying the foundation for product success.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Elevate Your Feature Development\\r\\n\\r\\nReady to redefine your feature development strategy?

You\'ll learn how it\'s revolutionizing customer engagement, heightening user satisfaction, and fueling business growth. So fasten your seat belts and get ready to explore the immense potential that lies at the intersection of conversation design and AI.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Unpacking Conversation Design\\r\\n\\r\\nAI has drastically revolutionized our communication paradigms. From Siri and Alexa to the ubiquitous chatbots on websites and social media platforms, AI-powered systems have infiltrated our daily lives. These marvels of technology process colossal volumes of data, continually adapt through machine learning, and deliver hyper-personalized responses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile AI brings unparalleled efficiency and accessibility to customer interactions, it is not a silver bullet for replicating the nuances of human conversation. That\'s where conversation design bridges the gap. It marries the analytical prowess of AI with the human art of crafting dialogues that echo with relevance and empathy.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why Conversation Design Matters in the AI Epoch\\r\\n\\r\\nConversation design is a confluence of psychology, linguistics, and user experience design, tasked with crafting not just functional but also engaging and delightful user dialogues.\\r\\n\\r\\nFundamentally, the focus is on creating interactions that mimic human conversation. This involves thorough user need assessments, journey mapping, and dialog scripting to gently shepherd users through a conversational experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this equation, variables like the user\'s intent, their emotional state, and the brand\'s tone need to be keenly balanced to offer a harmonious interaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Principles for Crafting Stellar Conversation Designs\\r\\n\\r\\nEffective conversation design isn\'t accidental; it\'s a fine art guided by distinct principles:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **User-Centricity:** The user\'s needs and expectations are the compass. Design dialogues that align with their unique goals.\\r\\n2. **Natural Language Processing:** Deploy AI capabilities to understand and utilize the user\'s preferred language, regional colloquialisms, and established conversational norms for authentic engagements.\\r\\n3. **Contextual Awareness:** Recognize the situation or environment where the conversation takes place, integrating past interactions and current circumstances.\\r\\n4. **Emotional Intelligence:** Conversations must connect emotionally, requiring designers to build empathy into AI responses.\\r\\n5. **Iterative Feedback:** Conversation design is a living, breathing entity that must continually evolve based on user feedback and emerging trends.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Case Studies: Conversation Design in Action\\r\\n\\r\\nA host of companies have successfully leveraged conversation design to enhance their customer interactions.

With information or content architecture, how we group and label things directly affects how easily the information can be found and used. Information architecture becomes even more important as the information available keeps growing. When faced with a lot of information, it becomes harder to sift through and find what you need.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nGood information architecture enables people to find their way through the information and ignore irrelevant information. It not only helps people find information, but it also empowers them by helping them learn about what they find and make better decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, bad information architecture makes finding and using information more difficult. The content doesn\'t fit properly and is harder to find. For example, good information architecture for an online store would group all the candy bars and other snack foods together. Bad information architecture may group the items by manufacturer, making people look through every manufacturer to find candy bars. You don\'t want your users going on a scavenger hunt for the content they need.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three things to understand before designing an IA that works:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **People/Users: What they need to do, how they think, and what they already know.** To put it into perspective, think of this as \\"need to know\\" vs. \\"need to do.\\" If you don\'t understand the user, you won\'t be able to group content in ways that make sense to them. Your audience is key to your IA decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Content: What you have, what you should have, and what you need.** Without a good understanding of your content, you won\'t be able to create an information architecture that works well for current and future content.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Context: The business or personal goals for the site: your stakeholders and constraints.** If you don\'t know the context, you won\'t be able to create something that works for people and the business, and you\'ll have endless trouble with the project.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\'s involved in the information architecture project\\r\\n\\r\\nAn IA project always starts with figuring out what is involved:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Define the project\\r\\n- Identify goals\\r\\n- Identify technologies used\\r\\n- Identify design constraints\\r\\n- Identify stakeholders\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter defining and identifying the project, you\'ll start gathering information and analyzing it to help you make a wide range of decisions during the project\'s life. In the research and gathering phase of the project, you\'re finding out what the users need, what they want, and what they know. You\'re also learning about the content, what exists, what doesn\'t, and what is possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nObserving user behavior and their questions is essential to the IA design. Once you\'ve researched and learned about the user, the Information Architect (Technical Writer in this case) designs the solutions with an IA structure to the defined problems and goals. At this point, testing ensures the navigation works for the specified goals. If new content needs to be prepared, this is the time to start.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout research into people and content, you won\'t be able to make good information architecture design decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deliverables of the information architecture project\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all of the details and IA structure have been sorted out, and you know the details of how the site should work, you can start the technical work\u2014build the site, add content, and test it before release.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IA deliverables include:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **The overall structure of the site.**\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Groups and subgroups that will be used in navigation. This describes what is included in each and the labeling.**\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Metadata that describes each page/topic, including keywords, author, reviewers, and date (last modified).**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe person creating the IA is the one who understands all the ins and outs because they understand the strategy, people, and content. This means they\'ll explain how the information architecture should work and other details about the project. The person will also listen to feedback, answer questions, understand the underlying issues, and make necessary changes to reach the desired outcome."},{"id":"/2022/02/23/how-much-does-quality-content-matter","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/02/23/how-much-does-quality-content-matter","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-23-how-much-does-quality-content-matter.mdx","title":"How much does quality content matter?","description":"The quality of your organization\'s technical documentation matters now more than ever.

In my experience, potential customers carefully evaluate technical documentation before purchasing. Whether an IT professional evaluating an enterprise application, a developer implementing an API, or a consumer using a product, they\'re reading your content to learn about the product and how to use it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf prospective customers cannot find high-quality technical or user documentation to support their purchase decisions, you may never have a chance to close the deal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n- Good **informational** content helps prospects become customers. They want to understand your capabilities and unique value. However, this type of content falls more into the hands of Marketing and Sales. It\'s the bait on the hook, so to speak.\\r\\n- Good **instructional** content and technical documentation help customers *remain* customers. They need fast, effective service. Organizing content around user roles and activities *empowers* them rather than frustrates them. Plus, it\'s integral to customer support, branding, and trust. If it\'s not there for them, they start looking for alternatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article provides information on content quality problems and ways to course-correct to create a good user experience when they use your product or service.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Costs and risks of content quality problems\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral dimensions make up good technical documentation:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Can the reader find it and understand it?\\r\\n- Is the content complete and accurate?\\r\\n- Is there consistent use of product branding and industry terminology?\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nWe can break these down further, but we\'ll stick with this high-level list for this article.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n### Findable\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, it\'s more important to be able to search the content. Technical documentation has evolved over the past decade, and it\'s primarily in an online help format with an option to download a PDF version. With that said, SEO in technical documentation helps search engines respond with the most relevant content.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn excellent example of SEO in technical documentation comes from Microsoft. In their content, on [docs.microsoft.com](http://docs.microsoft.com/), the `description` metadata field is required. It must follow Microsoft\'s SEO writing guidelines for its content contributors.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info\\r\\nIf you\'re unfamiliar with the example below, Microsoft develops its technical content using markdown in the Docfx docs-as-code framework.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n---\\r\\ntitle: Manage Azure portal settings and preferences\\r\\ndescription: Learn how to change Azure portal settings such as default subscription or directory, timeouts, menu mode, contrast, theme, notifications, language or region, and more.\\r\\ndate:  08/10/2021\\r\\ntopic: how-to\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Accurate and complete\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical documentation is living content continuously updating as new features are released, or operational processes change. Because of this, it must review for accuracy and completeness. Is the expected behavior of the product feature accurately described? Are the procedural steps accurate and complete?\\r\\n\\r\\nAccurate and complete means the user accomplished what they set out to do because the information was in the documentation. However, they\'re at a dead-end and left to call support if it\'s not there.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Consistent\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your company has a valuable brand, you\'ll suffer a tangible loss if branding isn\'t used consistently. Inconsistencies can confuse users or affect the company\'s brand. For example, the user might be confused about which content is correct, mainly if your content uses several terms interchangeably. In addition, the translations by human and machine translators can contain these inconsistencies if your content is localized.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Understandable\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if the content is accurate, complete, and consistent, it might not be understood. This is because so many factors come into play when we talk about whether someone understands it or not:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Sentence structure**: Does the sentence articulate the idea clearly and directly? Is the sentence so long it\'s too difficult to follow? Is the sentence too convoluted to understand? Does the sentence include information that adds nothing but confusion?\\r\\n- **Vocabulary**: Does the user understand the words? Is your content translated?\\r\\n- **Terminology**: Are the terms used correctly and consistently throughout the documentation?\\r\\n- **Spelling and grammar**: Does the content contain relatively simple errors that distract, confuse, or mislead your readers?\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where content quality problems come from\\r\\n\\r\\nContent quality problems can come from different areas. The top problem I\'ve observed is that the user is misunderstood\u2014that is, the overall user journey is overlooked. For example, IT professionals and developers are often misunderstood, so their content doesn\'t directly speak to them. What do I mean by this? Most often, the content is written by a very technical person, and then it\'s handed off for editing and formatting. There\'s rarely a discussion among the cross-functional teams on use cases or scenarios for the flow of the content, which would give the user what they need when needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI use the IT professional as an example because they have a hard job. Not one company has the same IT infrastructure implemented. Plus, there\'s a lot on their plate with supporting different operating systems, versions of applications, security and preventing intrusions, user administration, and evaluating solutions. Because of this, I have found that writing content for them works best in a scenario or goal-based format. The IT professional consults technical documentation for a reason: to get answers to their questions or implement an enterprise solution end-to-end. This format results in giving them what they need when they need it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA survey by author and content strategist Rachel McConnel clearly recognized how quality content adds value. However, this survey also recognized the adverse business impact of letting just *anyone* create the content. But at the moment, it\'s still a blind spot for some organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Ways to design and develop better content\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the dimensions of good technical documentation mentioned earlier, you\'ll want to understand the user journey by \\"designing the content.\\" Content design helps you develop better content by answering a user\'s need in the best way to consume it. Sarah Winters states in her book that content design is \\"\u2026about using data and evidence to give the user what they need, at the time they need it and in a way they expect it.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nContent design is not just writing. It\'s a way of thinking. It\'s collaborating with cross-functional teams like UX, product owners, and engineers to find the best solutions to give the user what they need when they need it and how they expect it. For example, the content could be a one-pager, a complete user guide, a training module, etc. It could even be as small as UX/in-platform microcopy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic principle here is that the user\'s needs come first, then the format. You\'re creating content that helps create a good experience for the user when using your product or service. You\'re helping them along their journey!\\r\\n\\r\\n- **User needs come first**: Research your user\'s wants and needs. It can be user research, usability research, industry research, expert research, or any kind of research with data and evidence of what the user wants and needs.\\r\\n- **Give them what they need when they need it**: We know that giving people information too early or in the wrong place can make people leave in frustration and no longer trust you. Understanding what your user needs \u2013 when they need it \u2013 can be the difference between success and failure.\\r\\n- **In the way they expect it**: Use your users\' language. You don\'t use language for search engines \u2013 you use it for the humans behind those engines. You don\'t pull people into useless search results. Instead, you help people. The language used in a product must reflect your user\'s vocabulary, or they may find the interaction too difficult and eventually abandon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, once you better understand the user journey, you\'ll have a complete picture of what kind of content your user needs at each step of their journey to help them decide. Putting the user\'s needs first results in quality documentation and builds trust.\\r\\n\\r\\n## References\\r\\n\\r\\nWinters, S. (05 December 2019). What is Content Design?

Many people begin without knowing where to start or realizing the extent of the work involved. Video production is not a simple matter of recording and pressing play when you\'re done. It takes several hours to make a few minutes of high-quality video. A few tasks in creating a well-produced video include planning, scriptwriting, recording the video, recording and editing the voiceover, and rendering. \\r\\n\\r\\n## What qualities make a great how-to video?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you read this article, think about your own experience as a viewer. What did you find helpful and not so helpful about the video? Was the message clear, did it flow and stick to the intended message, and did it keep you engaged throughout? Most importantly, did you get what you needed out of the video, or did it waste your time, and you didn\'t get much out of it?  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following four qualities guide you from planning to writing a solid script to recording your video and selecting a voiceover professional. \\r\\n\\r\\n### 1. Having a good script with a clear message matters \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have a world-class product, a weak script sabotages your video, making it dull at best and confusing at worst. Always plan what you\'re going to say. It\'s easy to ramble when you record. Instead, have a plan.\\r\\n\\r\\n> An excellent how-to video script takes work.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Define your message.** Start by making a creative brief to establish the audience, goals, problems, solutions, and the proper tone. Next, you\'ll want to start with the actual words. This is necessary to help tailor the message. Finally, be straightforward and confident in your message. Keep these things in mind when defining your message:\\r\\n\\r\\n    1. Why the video, and what\'s your angle? Don\'t make a video for the fun of it. Know your goal because you\'re either filling in an information gap or expanding your viewer\'s knowledge. HOW are you making life easier for them?\\r\\n\\r\\n    2. Why will the viewer care? What are their pain points? What are they trying to solve?\\r\\n\\r\\n    3. Anticipate the viewer\'s questions and make sure they get answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n    4. What value will this provide to the viewer?\\r\\n\\r\\n    5. What should the viewer take away from this video? Your conclusion should have an impact. If your video is sharp up until a shrug of a closer, all your work will be for nothing. You shouldn\'t end with an overtly sales-based message, but instead, there should be a final takeaway.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Communicate your brand.** If you\'re only mentioning features in your video, then you\'re just playing it safe. Your viewers want to know how things impact them. Even if it\'s common sense, tell the viewer about how your product or idea benefits **them**. Consider what you\'d like to hear if \\"you\\" were the customer. You\'re positioning the product as the \\"Secret Sauce\\" to solve or prevent the problem. After putting in the secret sauce, explain \\"Why\\" it works.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Work with a professional scriptwriter.** The script is the video\'s message; it\'s what you want to tell and transmit in the video.\\r\\n    The writer helps \\"engage\\" the right audience and makes them want to learn more (and keep on watching). The writer also helps keep the video length at just the right size; the longer the video, the more view drops it\'s likely to have.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. High-quality video recordings\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can record anything and everything on your screen, but it can end up as a not-so-great viewing experience. We get that not everyone uses the same  recording software, but here are a few things to ensure consistency for the best recording quality and viewing experience:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Set up your desktop recording area and your recording software.** Do not record \\"full screen\\" because it can record at a \\"not-so-great\\" aspect ratio. For example, recording at 1280x720 may seem small, but it\'s considered HD, plus it\'s the recommended size for YouTube videos.\\r\\n\\r\\n  ![16:9 ratio](../static/img/16-9-ratio.png) \\r\\n\\r\\n  >**Tip!** You can make a 1280 x 720px placeholder image for your desktop and then re-size any browser or application within the white space before you\\r\\n start to record.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Recording workflow and tips.** We want a smooth transition during mouse movements and screen changes so that no further editing is needed during postproduction.\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. De-clutter and clean up your desktop.\\r\\n\\r\\n  2. Close unused applications.\\r\\n\\r\\n  3. Turn off notifications and disable pop-ups.\\r\\n\\r\\n  4. Open the application you want to record and then do a couple of practice walkthroughs of precisely what you want to show your viewers. This helps with smooth cursor motions, and, in the end, there\'s more minor editing to do for the video production specialist.\\r\\n\\r\\n  5. When you\'re ready to record, start the recording and follow these tips:\\r\\n\\r\\n     - **Watch your mouse cursor.** You\'ll use it to show the viewer where to follow along while explaining things. It\'s essential, so make sure you make it as helpful as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n       - **Don\'t circle things.** Moving your mouse around as if you\'re talking with your hands leaves your viewers confused and unsure of where they should look. Instead, move it deliberately and with purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n       - **Don\'t move it at the speed of light.** If you\'re moving your mouse across the screen too fast, your audience struggles to follow along and, ultimately, stops watching.\\r\\n\\r\\n       - **If you can, try to cut out mistakes and unneeded content**. Mistakes happen to the best of us. You\'ll be recording, and your mouse moves to the wrong place, you click the wrong thing, or something unexpected happens. It\'s okay \u2013 it\'s fixable.\\r\\n\\r\\n     - **Allow 5 seconds of silence before beginning your tutorial** (following along with the script). This allows a buffer, so you don\'t cut off anything you meant to record on the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\n     - **As you record, speak in a conversational tone (following the script),** as if you were training someone sitting next to you. Be straightforward with your language. Take your time to say WHAT you\'re doing and WHY you\'re doing it. Then, let the actions speak for themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n       Talking as you record helps with the smooth transition and stays at a pace that you would typically see in a one-on-one training session. Plus, when you speak following along with the script, the professional voiceover can be efficiently timed with the actions. Don\'t worry about fumbling over your words because your audio is edited out during postproduction.\\r\\n\\r\\n        > **Tip!** If you go off-script, but it\'s a valuable tidbit for the user, the voiceover professional can modify the script.\\r\\n\\r\\n     - **Allow 5 seconds of silence at the end of the recording**. Here you want to make sure you don\'t cut anything off.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3. Utilize a voiceover professional\\r\\nThe quality of the narration makes a big difference in the overall quality of your video. Let\'s face it, folks, lousy narration turns off viewers faster than almost anything else. So, the importance of a clear and articulate voice in visual content is undeniable. If you want to reach a broad audience and keep them engaged, the narration must be excellent. You can ruin webinars and presentations by using the wrong voice. As a result, viewers turn their attention to the voice behind the message.\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting and keeping your viewers\' attention is why you need professional voiceovers. They are persuasive and give the right rhythm to your script. They train their voices for years and know how to make any communication exciting and easy to follow. Plus, they enjoy their jobs and smile, which can be heard in their voice and makes your video content more appealing. Professional voiceovers know how to control breath and rhythm so that the audience doesn\'t hear any disturbing pauses while listening.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn otherwise fantastic video is dead without the right voice to match the video\'s tone. Hire a professional whose sound resonates with your audience. Find someone specializing in the genre. You\'d be surprised how many voiceover professionals specialize in a particular genre, such as technical or medical content. Professional voiceover is excellent, and (if you have the budget), bringing one in-house to record is always the best approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour videos say a lot about your company and how you do business. And people tend to associate the quality of your content with the quality of your products or services.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Source:\\r\\n> Professional Voice-Overs Are Essential For Your Video ....\\r\\n> https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/professional-voice-overs/\\r\\n\\r\\n### 4. Include a call-to-action: \\r\\n\\r\\nPeople need a prompt, even if it\'s as simple as a nudge to visit the website or share it with colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Final thoughts\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s all about balance:\\r\\n>>*Explain; don\'t lecture.*<br />\\r\\n>>*Engage; don\'t bore.*<br />\\r\\n>>*Enchant; don\'t demand.*"}]}')}}]);
