This page is about me and what I enjoy doing:
- [Docs-as-code content management system](https://docsascodepresentation.patriciamcphee.repl.co/#1) (CMS) development, such as Docusaurus, Gatsby, and Jekyll
- UX Writing (UI strings and in-platform microcopy)
- Graphic and visual design (newsletters, brochures, and eBooks)
- Full stack and responsive web development (React/Express/Node.js)
- Scenario-based technical content development for engineers 
- Innovating, collaborating with colleagues, and expanding my skills


## How I became a Content Designer
My journey into content design/strategy started 25 years ago on the Human-Centered Design & Engineering team at a large telecommunications company. There I learned how to conduct usability tests (participant observation) to uncover and solve user experience challenges with end-user documentation. Over the past two decades, I've worked in technical writing, helping organizations reduce, simplify, and restructure their digital end-user documentation, ensuring quality and accuracy, and increasing customer satisfaction rates.

Before content design/technical writing, I was a graphic designer specializing in page layout and design (desktop publishing for textbooks, user manuals, magazines, and newsletters). This has helped me quickly understand the fundamentals and concepts of UX Design for the digital world, especially for end-user documentation.

After graphic design and before content design/technical writing, I worked in technical support and network system administration for about five years. I also have a Computer Science degree through DeVry with a minor in software development and Full Stack Web Development (MongoDB, Express, React, Node (MERN)) training through various freelance projects and [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/?hsa_mt=p&hsa_ad=&hsa_ver=3&hsa_tgt=kwd-71400272294570:loc-190&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_grp=1142393539690917&hsa_src=o&hsa_cam=1598884287&hsa_acc=1437185464&hsa_kw=careerfoundry%20web%20development&msclkid=93af5a0aa51d19d51856395413571273&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=BR_ALL_gEN_cXX&utm_term=careerfoundry%20web%20development&utm_content=Dev_careerfoundry).

I love docs-as-code frameworks for universal documentation sites and Information Architecture. I've built online help systems or doc sites using various frameworks and purposes for the past 20+ years. Early in my career, I helped run usability tests for "online" technical content, like knowledge bases. I found this fascinating because my graphic design training was initially in print design for books, magazines, and the like.

## What I do as a Content Designer

- Think through projects strategically and creatively, from ideation through production, working with cross-functional teams (Design, Product, Marketing, and Support) to uncover and solve UX challenges.
- Strategize, implement, and maintain a consistent content strategy through the product experience.
- Use empathy, logic, and data to inform writing, editing, and design decisions.
- Apply customer-centric thinking to all product design elements, focusing on clarity, coherence, quality, accessibility, and mapping out content flows.
- Integrate storytelling for increased stakeholder engagement. Oscillate between left- and right-brained writing, from storytelling to systematic thinking.
- Develop guidelines, create architect frameworks, and inform design solutions.
- Create content that follows all guidelines, including UX content, SEO, accessibility, design system, localization, and legal.
- Use the [minimalism](https://everypageispageone.com/2013/07/02/what-is-minimalism/) approach to create useful content that is clear and simple without unnecessary distractions.
- Thrive in a collaborative and feedback-rich environment.
- Ask lots of questions.
- Think long-term, but act quickly.


## Where I'm going next in my career

About 12 years ago, I started to explore different careers like Medical Writer, Voiceover/Voice Actor ([listen to my demos](https://soundcloud.com/patriciamcphee/sets/voiceover-demos)), or returning to my roots as a Graphic Designer. I considered becoming a UX/UI Designer, Instructional Designer, or Web Developer.   

During my exploration, I realized I enjoy developing content management systems using static-site generators like the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) docs-as-code frameworks. So after exploring, I decided to take an immersive Full Stack Web Development specialty through [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/). You could say I'm a Web Developer disguised as a Content Designer/Strategist/Information Architect.

I aim to bring my programming skills up to par and graduate by December 2022 (with an official certificate because I'm self-taught up to this point). After that, I'll transition to UX/UI Designer, UX Engineer, UX Unicorn, Full-Stack Designer, or whatever it's called these days. I might even consider moving to a Product Manager roleâ€”just something where I can utilize my diverse skill set and 25+ years of experience.
