## How I became a Technical Writer
I've been in IT in different capacities for the past 25 years, starting in support and moving to network system administration. However, for the past 20 years, I've been working as a Technical Writer. I specialize in taking the guesswork out of complex technical content for busy IT professionals and developers. 

Look over my [resume](resume.mdx) to learn more about what I've done.
