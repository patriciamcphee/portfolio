<h2>About Me!</h2>

My journey into user-centric writing started over 20 years ago on a human-centered design and engineering team at a large telecommunications company. There, I learned how to conduct usability tests (participant observation and user behavior) to uncover and solve user experience challenges with end-user documentation.

As a technical writer with 27 years of experience, I have honed my ability to distill complex information into straightforward, concise, and user-friendly content. Through my work, I have developed a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of communicating effectively with diverse audiences. These skills are essential in creating conversational experiences that are engaging but also accurate and informative.

Throughout my career, I have been involved in various documentation projects, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, including software developers, UX designers, and product managers. This experience has given me a holistic understanding of the software development lifecycle and the importance of seamless communication between users and technology. I am adept at conducting user research, understanding user needs, and applying user-centered design principles to create conversational interfaces that meet the end userâ€™s expectations and goals.

Key strengths that I bring to a my roles include:

<h2>About this site</h2>

I used [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to build this writing portfolio. I started using Docusaurus at the beginning of 2020 and continue to play around with customization. Before that, I used other static-site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, and DocFx as my primary authoring environment. So far, my favorite is Docusaurus. Although I like DocFx, it's a bit more complicated to set up.

The purpose of using the Docusaurus framework to host my writing samples was to make it easier to share and showcase my work!
