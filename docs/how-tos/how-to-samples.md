Guides cover the main use cases that we envision people using the product. It would outline a use case and then provide the steps that the user would take to accomplish their goal. It would also give some examples of how the product could be used.

How-tos are an informal, often short, description of how to complete some specific task. A how-to is usually meant to help non-experts, may leave out details that are only important to experts, and may also be greatly simplified from an overall discussion of the topic.
