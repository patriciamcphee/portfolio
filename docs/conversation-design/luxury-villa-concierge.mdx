Luxury Villas Inc. rents 5000 vacation houses at 20 different locations worldwide. 

Our large beach houses offer exclusive, high-quality services in a traditional VIP setting for high-income families earning $100,000 or more annually. 

Guests can ask the virtual concierge questions about the villa and things to do in the area so guests can experience all highlights, such as the golf clinic for kids or the chef's dinner on Thursday.

Each room is equipped with a smart speaker for convenience, and our website and mobile app feature a chatbot to assist with any inquiries guests may have.

### Bot personality

The bot will serve as a virtual concierge in each home, guiding guests through the park and helping them with other things. For example, making reservations for dining, transportation, entertainment, or special events. They provide information about local attractions, services, and amenities.
