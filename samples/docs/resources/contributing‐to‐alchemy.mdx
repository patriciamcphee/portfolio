Alchemy is our [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) instance — a platform for building developer portals. Our vision is for Alchemy to become the trusted standard toolbox (UX layer) for our infrastructure landscape, similar to what Kubernetes is for container orchestration.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to set up your development environment and start contributing to the project.

By contributing to this project, you agree to follow our team's guidelines that ensure smooth collaboration, high code quality, and an inclusive environment.

## Development environment setup

### Required software

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

1. **Node.js v20**
   - We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions
   - Run `nvm install 20` and `nvm use 20` to ensure you're using the correct version

2. **Python 3.11**
   - Alchemy is built on a framework that is incompatible with Python 3.12
   - Verify your installation with `python --version` or `python3 --version`

3. **Yarn**
   - Install globally with `npm install -g yarn`
   - Verify with `yarn --version`

4. **Git**
   - Latest version recommended
   - Configure your Git identity:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
     ```

5. **NPM Artifactory configuration**
   - Configure NPM to use the correct Cigna address:
     ```bash
     npm config -g set registry "http://repo.sys.cigna.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm-repos"
     ```

### Recommended VS Code extensions

For an optimal development experience with VS Code, we recommend installing the following extensions:

1. **ESLint** (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`)
   - Integrates ESLint into VS Code for real-time linting

2. **Prettier - Code formatter** (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`)
   - Formats your code according to our style guidelines

3. **EditorConfig for VS Code** (`editorconfig.editorconfig`)
   - Helps maintain consistent coding styles across editors

4. **TypeScript Hero** (`rbbit.typescript-hero`)
   - Organizes imports and provides enhanced TypeScript support

5. **Jest** (`orta.vscode-jest`)
   - Provides testing integration for our Jest tests

6. **MDX** (`silvenon.mdx`)
   - Syntax highlighting for MDX files

7. **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** (`github.vscode-pull-request-github`)
   - Simplifies the PR review process directly from VS Code

8. **Thunder Client** (`rangav.vscode-thunder-client`)
   - API testing tool for testing Backstage backend APIs

9. **React Developer Tools** (Browser extension)
   - For debugging React components

### Installation steps

1. Install Node.js v20 using nvm or direct download
2. Install Python 3.11 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Install Yarn globally: `npm install -g yarn`
4. Configure NPM registry as shown above
5. Install VS Code and recommended extensions

## Getting started with the codebase

### Cloning the repo

1. Clone the Alchemy repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/alchemy.git
   cd alchemy
   ```

2. Set up Git hooks (if not automatically installed):
   ```bash
   yarn husky install
   ```

### Installing Dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository, install the dependencies:

```bash
# Change to root directory of project
cd /path/to/alchemy

# Install dependencies (may take a while)
yarn install

# Run initial type generation and checks
yarn tsc
```

### Local Configuration

Alchemy provides a CLI to help you set up your local configuration:

1. Install the Alchemy CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm i -g @cigna/cigna_alchemy_cli@latest
   ```

2. Configure Alchemy to use local GitHub secret:
   ```bash
   alchemy config use local --secret password
   ```

3. Create or modify `app-config.local.yaml` (gitignored) for any local overrides:
   - This file will be merged with `app-config.yaml`
   - Use this file to store sensitive information like API tokens
   - Example configuration:
     ```yaml
     auth:
       github:
         clientId: your-client-id
         clientSecret: your-client-secret
     ```

### Serving the Web App

Start the development server with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command:
- Starts the frontend (http://localhost:3000)
- Starts the backend (http://localhost:7007)
- Opens a browser window to the local instance automatically

You should see terminal output similar to:
```
$ concurrently "yarn start" "yarn start-backend"
$ yarn workspace example-app start
$ yarn workspace example-backend start
$ backstage-cli app:serve
$ backstage-cli backend:dev
[0] Loaded config from app-config.yaml
[1] Build succeeded
[0] ℹ ｢wds｣: Project is running at http://localhost:3000/
```

## Contribution Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We use GitHub Flow for our branching strategy:

1. **Main Branch**:
   - The `main` branch is always deployable and production-ready
   - All changes must be approved through Pull Requests

2. **Feature Branches**:
   - Create directly from `main` using the format:
     `feature/<JIRA-TICKET-ID>-short-description`
   - Example: `feature/FDAEAPTD-123-add-authentication`

3. **Bugfix Branches**:
   - Create from `main` using:
     `bugfix/<JIRA-TICKET-ID>-short-description`
   - Example: `bugfix/FDAEAPTD-234-fix-navbar`

4. **Version Branches**:
   - Created when preparing for a release using:
     `v<version-number>`

### Opening Pull Requests

1. **PR Title and Description**:
   - Write clear titles referencing the Jira ticket:
     `FDAEAPTD-123: Add user authentication with OAuth2`
   - Include context, purpose, and links to Jira issues:
     `Resolves [FDAEAPTD-123](https://jira.express-scripts.com/browse/FDAEAPTD-123)`

2. **Update CHANGELOG**:
   - For user-facing changes, update the `[UNRELEASED]` section

3. **Jira Ticket Management**:
   - Update ticket status as you progress:
     - **In Progress**: When you start work
     - **In Review**: When you create the PR
     - **Done**: When the PR is merged

4. **PR Size**:
   - Keep PRs small and focused to simplify reviews
   - Consider breaking large changes into multiple PRs

### PR Review Process

Our "No Double Jeopardy" principle ensures efficiency:
- Reviewers provide all significant feedback in the first review
- Only new issues emerging from changes may be raised in subsequent reviews

For more details on our review process, see the [PR Review Guidelines](#technical-standards) section.

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality

1. **Linting and Formatting**:
   - Run `yarn lint` before committing changes
   - This command runs only on files you've changed

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use descriptive variable and function names
   - Follow React component naming conventions (PascalCase)
   - Use camelCase for variables and functions

3. **Code Simplicity**:
   - Keep code simple; avoid unnecessary complexity
   - Complex solutions should only be used when simpler alternatives won't work

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - A consistent coding style is enforced via `.editorconfig`
   - Your editor should respect these settings automatically

### Testing Requirements

1. **Testing Framework**:
   - Jest for unit testing
   - Playwright for end-to-end testing

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Minimum 80% test coverage required
   - Run tests with `yarn test`

3. **Test Synchronization**:
   - Keep test cases in sync with code changes
   - Add new tests for new features or bug fixes

### Documentation

1. **README Updates**:
   - Keep README.md up to date with major changes

2. **API Documentation**:
   - Document APIs and workflows in the TechDocs plugin

3. **Code Comments**:
   - Add comments to explain complex logic
   - Document public APIs and functions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Node Version Incompatibility**:
   - Error: `The engine "node" is incompatible with this module`
   - Solution: Ensure you're using Node.js v20 with `nvm use 20`

2. **Module Resolution Errors**:
   - Error: `Cannot find module`
   - Solution: Try `yarn clean && yarn install`

3. **TypeScript Errors**:
   - Run `yarn tsc` to check for type errors
   - Ensure your IDE TypeScript version matches the project

4. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Error during build or startup related to missing packages
   - Solution: Run `yarn install` to update dependencies

### SSL and Network Configuration

For corporate networks or when dealing with SSL issues:

1. **Disable Node TLS Checks** (for development only):
   ```bash
   export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED="0"
   ```

2. **Allow External API Calls Through zScaler**:
   ```bash
   export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS="./packages/backend/extra-ca-certs.pem"
   ```

Note: Execute these commands from the root of the Alchemy repo in the same terminal where you will run the backend. You can also add these to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` to make them apply globally.

3. **Proxy Configuration**:
   - If you're behind a corporate proxy, configure npm:
     ```bash
     npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
     npm config set https-proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
     ```
