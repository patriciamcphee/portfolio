My writing samples site was built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) framework, GitHub Pages to host the site, and markdown to write the content. I originally built it in Jekyll as a challenge to myself in 2018 as a way to showcase my writing samples in an online format, rather than in PDF format. 

Around 2015, I started using markdown more as the primary format for content mostly in Confluence and other wiki platforms. In 2018, I started using static-site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Docusaurus, and DocFx as a primary authoring envinronment. I have to say, my favorite, so far, has been Docusuarus. I do like DocFx, but it's bit more complicated to set up.
