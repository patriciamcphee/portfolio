I'm a self-driven Sr. Technical and UX Writer. I've been in IT in different capacities for the past 25 years, starting in support and moving to network system administration. My expertise is in taking the guesswork out of complex technical content for busy IT professionals. 

Over the last ten years, I have helped organizations reduce, simplify, and restructure their content, ensuring quality and accuracy, resulting in increased overall customer satisfaction rates.


## Accomplishments 

- Wrote shell scripts to automate OpenAPI content publishing for Extreme Networks.
- Streamlined a weekly team status report for the Amazon executive team, reducing the time to compile and deliver the report by ~4 hours (more than half).
- Rewrote a decades-old installation/upgrade guide for the GE Healthcare customers and support team, reducing the time to install/upgrade, data loss or corruption, and support calls.
- Built a _**custom**_ authoring environment in MadCap Flare and converted legacy content for several large corporations to maximize content reuse and to reduce the cost of creating, managing, and publishing content.
