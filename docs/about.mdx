## How I became a Technical Writer
I've been in IT in different capacities for the past 25 years, starting in support and moving to network system administration. However, for the past 20 years, I've been working as a Technical Writer. I specialize in taking the guesswork out of complex technical content for busy IT professionals and developers. 

## Where I'm going next in my career
About 12 years ago, I started to explore different careers like Medical Writer, Voiceover/Voice Actor or returning to my roots as a Graphic Designer. I even considered transitioning to UX/UI Designer, Instructional Designer, or Web Developer. However, after exploring these possibilities, I decided on Full Stack Web Developer.

Yes, UX/UI Design and Instructional Design seem like an easy transition for a Technical Writer, but I wanted something challenging. Plus, from observation, everyone is transitioning to these two careers. And for me, these two careers wouldn't be much of a challenge.

During all of my exploring, I discovered that I enjoy developing content management systems using static-site generators like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) docs-as-code frameworks. In the past, I've built technical content management systems from scratch using MadCap Flare or Robohelp, but I fell in love with open-source platforms. So next, I want to try the [Docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx_getting_started.html) docs-as-code framework.

Fast-forward to today, this is where [CareerFoundy](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/) comes into the picture. I'm currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development program. My goal is to bring my programming skills up to par, graduate by August 2022, and transition out of technical writing at a full-time capacity to something more challenging by the end of 2023. For example, be a Content Manager over a group of Technical Writers or build docs-as-code platforms for startups. 

So, I'm not walking away as a Technical Writer; I'm just going more behind the scenes in building and managing authoring platforms and training new Technical Writers.
