Dear Hiring Team,

I am expressing my interest in the Senior Technical Writer position at AuthenticID. With over eight years of professional experience in technical writing and content development in technology sectors, this role is my top choice for the next step in my career.

**Relevant Experience and Skills**

As someone who has created and maintained a wide range of customer-facing technical content—from product documentation and release notes to knowledge base articles—I know what it takes to produce high-quality, impactful content. My experience extends to enterprise B2B SaaS sectors, making me particularly suited for your company's specific needs.

At Beyond Identity and Keyavi Data, both cybersecurity SaaS companies, I led content audits and developed Docusaurus-based doc sites, enhancing content management and accessibility. I've also optimized the Azure VMware Solution learning and support documentation at Microsoft, reducing implementation time by 60%. You can review my writing samples and portfolio at [www.patriciamcphee.com/writing-samples](https://www.patriciamcphee.com/writing-samples).

**Project Approach and Working Style**

In terms of managing the technical writing backlog and status-tracking dashboard, my approach is deeply rooted in data-driven decision-making and collaboration. I have successfully developed tailored MadCap Flare authoring environments, resulting in an approximately 30% optimization in technical documentation creation and management for companies like GE Healthcare and Amazon.

I pride myself on my ability to work under strict deadlines with limited resources, thanks to my adeptness at automating workflows. For example, I automated API content publishing for Extreme Networks, reducing the time to curate the API or SDK documentation by about 40%.

**Educational Background**

My educational background includes a BS in Health/Environmental Science from Kaplan University and an AS in Computer Science from DeVry University, both of which have provided me with a broad view of technical content needs in various industries.

**Call to Action**

I am keen to bring my expertise in technical writing, quality content development, and continuous improvement to your organization. My hands-on experience and collaborative working style make me an excellent fit for your company's focus on delivering outstanding customer-facing technical content.

I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your team and would love to discuss this opportunity further. Please let me know when we can schedule an interview to explore how I can add value to your esteemed organization.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my suitability for this position in greater detail.

Best regards,
Patricia McPhee
