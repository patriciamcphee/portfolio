The quality of your organization's technical documentation matters now more than ever. I have found in my experience that potential customers also evaluate the technical documentation carefully before they buy. Whether an IT professional evaluating an enterprise application, a developer implementing an API, or a consumer using a product, they're reading your content to learn about the product and how to use it.

If your prospective customers cannot find high-quality technical or user documentation to support their purchase decisions, you may never have a chance to close the deal.

- Good **informational** content helps your prospects become customers. They want to understand your capabilities and unique value. However, know that this type of content falls more into the hands of Marketing and Sales. It's the bait on the hook, so to speak.

- Good **instructional** content and technical documentation help your customers *remain* your customers. They need fast, effective service. Organizing content around user roles and activities *empowers* them rather than frustrates them. Plus, it's an integral part of customer support, branding, and trust. If it's not there for them, they start looking for alternatives.

In this article, you'll learn about content quality problems and learn ways to course-correct so that you create a good user experience when they use your product or service.  

## Costs and risks of content quality problems

There are several dimensions to good technical documentation:

- Can the reader find it and understand it?

- Is the content complete and accurate?

- Is there a consistent use of product branding and industry terminology?

:::note
We can break these down further, but we'll stick with this high-level list for this article.

### Findable

Today, it's more important to be able to search the content. In addition, technical documentation has evolved, especially over the past decade. Technical documentation is primarily in an online help format with an option to download a PDF version. With that said, SEO in technical documentation helps search engines respond with the most relevant content.

A great example of SEO in technical documentation comes from Microsoft. In their content, on docs.microsoft.com, the `description` metadata field is required. It must follow the SEO writing guidelines that Microsoft lays out for their content contributors.

If you're unfamiliar with the example below, Microsoft develops its technical content using markdown in the Docfx docs-as-code framework.

### Accurate and complete

Technical documentation is living content that is continuously updated as new features are released, or operational processes change. Because of this, it must be reviewed for accuracy and completeness. Is the expected behavior of the product feature accurately described? Are the procedural steps accurate and complete?

Accurate and complete means the user accomplished what they set out to do because the information was in the documentation. However, they're at a dead-end and left to call support if it's not there.

### Consistent

If your company has a valuable brand, you'll suffer a tangible loss if branding isn't used consistently. Inconsistencies can confuse users or affect the company's brand. For example, the user might be confused about which content is correct, mainly if your content uses several terms interchangeably. In addition, the translations by human and machine translators can contain these inconsistencies if your content is localized.

### Understandable

Even if the content is accurate, complete, and consistent, it might not be understood. This is because so many factors come into play when we talk about whether someone understands it or not:

- **Sentence structure**: Does the sentence articulate the idea clearly and directly? Is the sentence so long it's too difficult to follow? Is the sentence too convoluted to understand? Does the sentence include information that adds nothing but confusion?

- **Vocabulary**: Does the user understand the words? Is your content translated?

- **Terminology**: Are the terms used correctly and consistently throughout the documentation?

- **Spelling and grammar**: Does the content contain relatively simple errors that distract, confuse, or mislead your readers?

## Where content quality problems come from

Content quality problems can come from different areas. The top problem I've observed is that the user is misunderstood—that is, the overall user journey is overlooked. For example, IT professionals and developers are often misunderstood, so their content doesn't directly speak to them. What do I mean by this? Most often, the content is written by a very technical person, and then it's handed off for editing and formatting. There's rarely a discussion among the cross-functional teams on use cases or scenarios for the flow of the content, which would give the user what they need when they need it.  

I use the IT professional as an example because they have a hard job. Not one company has the same IT infrastructure implemented. Plus, there's a lot on their plate with supporting different operating systems, versions of applications, security and preventing intrusions, user administration, and evaluating solutions. Because of this, I have found that writing content for them works best if it's in a scenario or goal-based format. The IT professional consults technical documentation for a reason: get answers to their questions or implement an enterprise solution end-to-end. This format results in giving them what they need when they need it.

A survey conducted by author and content strategist Rachel McConnel clearly recognized how quality content adds value. However, this same survey also recognized the adverse business impact of letting just *anyone* create the content. But at the moment, it's still a blind spot for some organizations.

## Ways to design and develop better content

In addition to the dimensions to good technical documentation mentioned earlier, you'll want to understand the user journey by "designing the content." Content design helps you develop better content because it answers a user's need in the best way to consume it. Sarah Winters states in her book that content design is "…about using data and evidence to give the user what they need, at the time they need it and in a way they expect it."

Content design is not just writing. It's a way of thinking. It's collaborating with cross-functional teams like UX, product owners, and engineers to find the best solutions to give the user what they need when they need it and how they expect it. For example, the content could be a one-pager, a complete user guide, a training module, and so on. It could even be as small as UX/in-platform microcopy.

The basic principle here is that user needs come first, then comes the format. You're creating content that helps create a good experience for the user when using your product or service. You're helping them along their journey!

- **User needs come first**:  Research what your user wants and needs. It can be user research, usability research, industry research, expert research, or any kind of research with data and evidence of what the user wants and needs.

- **Give them what they need when they need it**: We know that giving people information too early or in the wrong place can make people leave in frustration and no longer trust you. Understanding what your user needs – when they need it – can be the difference between success and failure.

- **In the way they expect it**: Use the language your users are using. You don't use language for search engines – you use it for the humans behind those engines. You don't pull people into useless search results. Instead, you help people. Language used in a product must reflect your user's vocabulary, or they may find the interaction too difficult and eventually abandon it.

In the end, once you have a better understanding of the user journey, you'll have a complete picture of what kind of content your user needs at each step of their journey to help them make a decision. Putting the user's needs first results in quality documentation and builds trust.
