This page is about me and what I enjoy doing:
- Content management system (CMS) development
- Technical content development
- UX Writing (UI strings and in-platform microcopy)
- Web development
- Learning and exploring new things

## How I became a technical writer
I've been in IT in different capacities for the past 25 years, starting in support and moving to network system administration. However, for the past 20 years, I've been working as a Technical Writer. My expertise is taking the guesswork out of complex technical content for busy IT professionals. 

## Where I'm going next in my career
About 12 years ago, I became disenchanted with my career choice. So I started to explore different careers like Medical Writer, Voiceover/Voice Actor or returning to my roots as a Graphic Designer. I even considered transitioning to UX/UI Designer, Instructional Designer, or Web Developer. However, after exploring these possibilities, I decided on Full Stack Web Developer.

Yes, UX/UI Design and Instructional Design seem like an easy transition for a Technical Writer aiming to change careers within the next couple of years, but I wanted something challenging. Plus, from observation, everyone and their dog are transitioning to these two careers. And for me, these two careers wouldn't be much of a challenge.

During all of my exploring, I also discovered that I enjoy developing content management systems using static-site generators like [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). In the past, I've built technical content management systems from scratch using MadCap Flare or Robohelp, but I fell in love with open-source platforms. Next, I want to try [Docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx_getting_started.html).

This is where [CareerFoundy](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-web-developer/) comes into the picture. I'm currently enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development program. My goal is to graduate by August 2022 and transition out of technical writing at a full-time capacity to something more challenging by the end of 2023.
