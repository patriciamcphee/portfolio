Beyond Identity provides an extensive rule-based decision policy engine that allows you to customize access decisions based on various attributes from various sources, such as user, device, event, and third-party integrations.

You create policy rules to allow or restrict access to users, devices, apps, and event behavior. It ensures that users attempting a specific transaction, such as authenticating to web apps or adding a device, must meet the policy rule requirements defined to gain access.
