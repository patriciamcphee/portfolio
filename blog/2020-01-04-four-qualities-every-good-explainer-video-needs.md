Let's face it, everyone likes learning something new. Your audience is a curious bunch, no matter who they are, which is why how-to/explainer videos are perfect for any target audience. These videos are short, engaging breakdowns of broader concepts or tasks. They are also one of the most effective ways to quickly show viewers a big idea or how to do something. How-to/explainer videos must be easy to consume and to achieve this, the information delivered must be clear.

A well-produced video can undoubtedly enhance the experience for your viewers, but a well-produced video takes planning to meet a high standard of quality and clarity. Many people begin without knowing where to start or realizing the extent of the work involved. Video production is not a simple matter of recording and pressing play when you're done. It takes several hours to make a few minutes of high-quality video. A few tasks in creating a well-produced video include planning, scriptwriting, recording the video, recording and editing the voiceover, and rendering. 

## What qualities make a great how-to video?

As you read this article, think about your own experience as a viewer. What did you find helpful and not so helpful about the video? Was the message clear, did it flow and stick to the intended message, and did it keep you engaged throughout? Most importantly, did you get what you needed out of the video, or did it waste your time, and you didn't get much out of it?  

The following four qualities guide you from planning to writing a solid script to recording your video and selecting a voiceover professional. 

### 1. Having a good script with a clear message matters 

If you have a world-class product, a weak script sabotages your video, making it dull at best and confusing at worst. Always plan what you're going to say. It's easy to ramble when you record. Instead, have a plan.

> An excellent how-to video script takes work.

- **Define your message.** Start by making a creative brief to establish the audience, goals, problems, solutions, and the proper tone. Next, you'll want to start with the actual words. This is necessary to help tailor the message. Finally, be straightforward and confident in your message. Keep these things in mind when defining your message:

    1. Why the video, and what's your angle? Don't make a video for the fun of it. Know your goal because you're either filling in an information gap or expanding your viewer's knowledge. HOW are you making life easier for them?

    2. Why will the viewer care? What are their pain points? What are they trying to solve?

    3. Anticipate the viewer's questions and make sure they get answered.

    4. What value will this provide to the viewer?

    5. What should the viewer take away from this video? Your conclusion should have an impact. If your video is sharp up until a shrug of a closer, all your work will be for nothing. You shouldn't end with an overtly sales-based message, but instead, there should be a final takeaway.

- **Communicate your brand.** If you're only mentioning features in your video, then you're just playing it safe. Your viewers want to know how things impact them. Even if it's common sense, tell the viewer about how your product or idea benefits **them**. Consider what you'd like to hear if "you" were the customer. You're positioning the product as the "Secret Sauce" to solve or prevent the problem. After putting in the secret sauce, explain "Why" it works.

- **Work with a professional scriptwriter.** The script is the video's message; it's what you want to tell and transmit in the video.
    The writer helps "engage" the right audience and makes them want to learn more (and keep on watching). The writer also helps keep the video length at just the right size; the longer the video, the more view drops it's likely to have.

### 2. High-quality video recordings

You can record anything and everything on your screen, but it can end up as a not-so-great viewing experience. We get that not everyone uses the same  recording software, but here are a few things to ensure consistency for the best recording quality and viewing experience:

- **Set up your desktop recording area and your recording software.** Do not record "full screen" because it can record at a "not-so-great" aspect ratio. For example, recording at 1280x720 may seem small, but it's considered HD, plus it's the recommended size for YouTube videos.

  >**Tip!** You can make a 1280 x 720px placeholder image for your desktop and then re-size any browser or application within the white space before you
 start to record.

- **Recording workflow and tips.** We want a smooth transition during mouse movements and screen changes so that no further editing is needed during postproduction.

  1. De-clutter and clean up your desktop.

  2. Close unused applications.

  3. Turn off notifications and disable pop-ups.

  4. Open the application you want to record and then do a couple of practice walkthroughs of precisely what you want to show your viewers. This helps with smooth cursor motions, and, in the end, there's more minor editing to do for the video production specialist.

  5. When you're ready to record, start the recording and follow these tips:

     - **Watch your mouse cursor.** You'll use it to show the viewer where to follow along while explaining things. It's essential, so make sure you make it as helpful as possible.

       - **Don't circle things.** Moving your mouse around as if you're talking with your hands leaves your viewers confused and unsure of where they should look. Instead, move it deliberately and with purpose.

       - **Don't move it at the speed of light.** If you're moving your mouse across the screen too fast, your audience struggles to follow along and, ultimately, stops watching.

       - **If you can, try to cut out mistakes and unneeded content**. Mistakes happen to the best of us. You'll be recording, and your mouse moves to the wrong place, you click the wrong thing, or something unexpected happens. It's okay â€“ it's fixable.

     - **Allow 5 seconds of silence before beginning your tutorial** (following along with the script). This allows a buffer, so you don't cut off anything you meant to record on the screen.

     - **As you record, speak in a conversational tone (following the script),** as if you were training someone sitting next to you. Be straightforward with your language. Take your time to say WHAT you're doing and WHY you're doing it. Then, let the actions speak for themselves.

       Talking as you record helps with the smooth transition and stays at a pace that you would typically see in a one-on-one training session. Plus, when you speak following along with the script, the professional voiceover can be efficiently timed with the actions. Don't worry about fumbling over your words because your audio is edited out during postproduction.

        > **Tip!** If you go off-script, but it's a valuable tidbit for the user, the voiceover professional can modify the script.

     - **Allow 5 seconds of silence at the end of the recording**. Here you want to make sure you don't cut anything off.

### 3. Utilize a voiceover professional
The quality of the narration makes a big difference in the overall quality of your video. Let's face it, folks, lousy narration turns off viewers faster than almost anything else. So, the importance of a clear and articulate voice in visual content is undeniable. If you want to reach a broad audience and keep them engaged, the narration must be excellent. You can ruin webinars and presentations by using the wrong voice. As a result, viewers turn their attention to the voice behind the message.

Getting and keeping your viewers' attention is why you need professional voiceovers. They are persuasive and give the right rhythm to your script. They train their voices for years and know how to make any communication exciting and easy to follow. Plus, they enjoy their jobs and smile, which can be heard in their voice and makes your video content more appealing. Professional voiceovers know how to control breath and rhythm so that the audience doesn't hear any disturbing pauses while listening.

An otherwise fantastic video is dead without the right voice to match the video's tone. Hire a professional whose sound resonates with your audience. Find someone specializing in the genre. You'd be surprised how many voiceover professionals specialize in a particular genre, such as technical or medical content. Professional voiceover is excellent, and (if you have the budget), bringing one in-house to record is always the best approach.

Your videos say a lot about your company and how you do business. And people tend to associate the quality of your content with the quality of your products or services.

### 4. Include a call-to-action: 

People need a prompt, even if it's as simple as a nudge to visit the website or share it with colleagues.

## Final thoughts

It's all about balance:
>>*Explain; don't lecture.*<br />
>>*Engage; don't bore.*<br />
>>*Enchant; don't demand.*
