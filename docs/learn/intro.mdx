## What you'll learn in the main course


At the end of the main course, you'll have a better understanding of the following:
- History of Technical Writing
- Different authoring tools and formats used
- Different document types and the purpose of each
- User journey and why it's necessary for technical content development
- Use of topic-based writing and minimalism in technical documentation
- Benefits of single-sourcing and content reuse in technical documentation
- Scenario and goal-based writing for guiding the user along their journey

You'll also have writing samples from the exercises, which you can continue to refine. These samples are also helpful in the *Docs-and-Code: Using markdown and GitHub to publish technical documentation* module.
