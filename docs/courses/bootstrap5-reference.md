Welcome to the Bootstrap 5 course! For those unfamiliar, Bootstrap is a framework based on HTML and JavaScript designed to create responsive websites for various devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. A responsive website is optimized for all these devices, catering to the diverse range of devices used today. With Bootstrap's popularity among developers, it's crucial to get acquainted with it to build optimized and engaging sites.

## Getting Started

- **Browser Choice:** Begin by opening your browser. While both Chrome and Firefox are compatible, Chrome is recommended for this course.
- **Searching for Bootstrap:** In your browser's search bar, type "Bootstrap 5" to find the latest version. Click on the first link, which should be an introduction from the official Bootstrap site.

### Understanding Bootstrap Versions

Bootstrap has evolved with different versions. Although you might come across Bootstrap 4 or even Bootstrap 3, the latest version is Bootstrap 5. It's essential to note that Bootstrap continuously updates, introducing new features and versions.

### No JavaScript Required

One of the standout features of Bootstrap's carousel is that it doesn't necessitate any JavaScript coding. The framework handles all the functionality for you.

### Accessing Bootstrap Documentation

- The Bootstrap documentation is comprehensive, providing instructions on every feature. To access it, Go to [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/) and click **Docs > Content** link at the top of the Bootstrap site.
- The left panel of the documentation page lists all the sections, including the introduction, download, and content. Whenever you're unsure about a feature or need clarification, refer to this documentation.

### Choosing an Editor 

For this course, we'll use the editor 'Sublime Text'. However, other suitable alternatives include 'Notepad' and 'Visual Studio Code'. The choice is yours, but ensure you're comfortable with your chosen editor.

### Setting up Bootstrap 

- **Creating an HTML File:** Open Sublime Text and create a new HTML file. Ensure you have the correct HTML structure, including meta tags for UTF-8 and compatibility with Internet Explorer.
- **Including Bootstrap:** To integrate Bootstrap, return to the Bootstrap documentation and click 'download'. While you can download the complete source file, using the CDN option is recommended. Copy the provided line of code for CSS and paste it into the head section of your HTML. Copy the JavaScript code and place it at the bottom of the body section before closing it.
- Always ensure you have the correct links in place before beginning any lesson in this course. Save this base file as a starting point for subsequent lessons.

### Next Steps 

With everything set up, you're now ready to explore and use Bootstrap's various components and features. As you progress through the course, always refer to the saved file to ensure a smooth experience.

See you in the next lesson, and happy coding!
