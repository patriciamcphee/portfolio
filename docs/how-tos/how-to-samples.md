How-tos are easy-to-follow instructions that explain step-by-step how to perform a task or use a specific feature in an app. How-tos are focused procedural articles that help you complete a task.  For example, making cookies includes the ingredients, mixing them, and how and at what temperature to bake them. 

When I write how-to's, I use the [minimalism](https://www.stilo.com/2017/05/04/dita-and-minimalism/#:~:text=Minimalism%2C%20when%20applied%20to%20technical%20writing%2C%20should%20result,2%20Usable%203%20Minimal%204%20Appropriate%205%20Findable) approach.
