In this topic, you'll explore the importance of concise and scannable paragraphs in technical documentation. 

You'll learn about maintaining a word count of 50-150 words per paragraph, balancing context with readability. 



## Minimum length for all paragraphs

Give your paragraphs room and keep them short. The idea is to make your content easy to scan, so the recommended word count is **50-150 words**.

This range is the "just enough" or "ideal" range because it provides enough context without overwhelming the user. 

Here's an example of what 103 words looks like:

<div class="card-demo">
  <div class="card no-pointer">
    <div class="card__body">
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque convallis dapibus tempus. Aenean finibus sit amet ligula id congue. Donec id velit lacinia sapien molestie congue. Aliquam id dui vitae augue maximus tempus. Mauris at malesuada ante, ac imperdiet nisi. Donec dapibus tellus justo, ac rutrum lorem imperdiet porta. Fusce. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque convallis dapibus tempus. Aenean finibus sit amet ligula id congue. Donec id velit lacinia sapien molestie congue. Aliquam id dui vitae augue maximus tempus. Mauris at malesuada ante, ac imperdiet nisi. Donec dapibus tellus justo, ac rutrum lorem imperdiet porta. Fusce.</p>

## Introduction paragraphs

Think of the introduction paragraph for the topic as the *Abstract* of an essay or research article—it's a brief summary of the content's key points. 

However, for the headings and subheadings within the topic are meant to briefly describe the section.  

:::tip hint
It's recommended that all topics and the section headers have an introduction paragraph.  It provides enough information for the reader to decide whether to read or continue scanning the content. Users likely don't have time to sift through mountains of information. 
:::

Avoid starting with phrases such as "This topic describes..." or "This topic is about...."

Instead, use something like, "In this topic/guide, you'll do XYZ (what they will accomplish by the end).
