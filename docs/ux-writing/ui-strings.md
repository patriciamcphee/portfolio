description: Adding static text in the UI provides a far better user experience than nothing at all. For example, a UI can get complex like the Azure portal. Having that guidance in the Azure UI helps the IT professional, in this case, work more efficiently in Azure.

User interface text, or UI strings, appear on UI spaces and includes:

- **Control labels** identify controls and are placed directly on or next to the controls.

- **Static text** is not part of interactive control and provides users with detailed instructions or explanations to make informed decisions. Take the Azure portal, for example. Azure does an excellent job providing static text that offers helpful guidance. In addition, it often has a **Learn more** link to the user documentation.

## Design concepts

It's frequently thought that UI text is written after writing the code and relegated to product documentation and technical support. In reality, the UI text is written earlier as the UI is designed and coded. This text is seen more frequently than perhaps any other type of technical writing.

Comprehensible text is crucial to effective UI. Product managers and software developers should work with technical writers or UX writers on UI text. Writing the UI text is a critical part of the design process because text problems often reveal design problems. If the team has trouble explaining a design, it is often the design, not the explanation, that needs improving.

## Design considerations UI text

Consider the following when you think about the UI text and its placement in the UI:
- People read in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order (in Western cultures).
- Users aren't immersed in the UI itself but their work when using the software. 
- Users don't read UI text; **they scan it**. When scanning, users may appear to be reading text when filtering it in reality. However, they often don't truly comprehend the UI text unless they perceive the need.
- Within a window, different UI elements receive different levels of attention. Users tend to read control labels first, especially those that appear relevant to completing the task at hand. By contrast, users tend to read static text only when they think they need to.

Also assume that once users have decided what to do, they will immediately stop reading and do it.
