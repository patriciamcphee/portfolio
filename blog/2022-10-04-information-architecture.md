When we create something, we also need to describe how to use it. With information architecture, how we group and label things directly affect how easily the information can be found and used. Information architecture becomes even more important as the information available keeps growing. When faced with a lot of information, it becomes harder to sift through and find what you need.

When the information architecture is good, people can find their way through the information and ignore what isn't relevant. Not only does good information architecture help people find information, but it also empowers them by helping them find the information they need, learn about it, and make better decisions. 

Bad information architecture makes it harder to find and use information, and the content doesn't easily fit. Good information architecture for an online store, for example, would group all the candy bars together and group them with other snack foods. Bad information architecture may group the items by the manufacturer, making people look through every manufacturer to see which ones make candy bars. Can you imagine if Amazon had bad information architecture? This also applies to end-user content.  You don't want your users going on a scavenger hunt for the content they need.  

Information architecture isn't easy for any number of reasons:

- There's always more than one way to organize it, and unfortunately, it isn't always clear what's the best way.
- People have different needs. In a corporation, for example, a designer has different needs than a developer or product manager. 
- People often have different ideas on what goes together and what doesn't. This is because of their differences in needs.
- Some people may know a lot about a topic, while others may know nothing (expert vs. novice).

As you can see, the last three reasons are related to PEOPLE. Organizing things in a way that makes sense to them fits with their idea of what goes together. 

There are three crucial things to understand before designing an IA that works:

![Three crucial things about design an IA that works: People/Users, Content, and Context.](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*j-oIpGC81NmSG0daT22aFg.jpeg)

- **People/Users:** What they need to do, how they think, and what they already know. To put it into perspective, think of this as "need to know" vs. "need to do." If you don't understand the user, you won't be able to group content in ways that make sense to them. Cloud Architects, for example, consult end-user documentation because they're trying to do something and need instructions on how to do it. In this particular case, you wouldn't want to bury conceptual information in the topic because it's assumed they know this information. See where I'm going with this? Your audience is key to your IA decisions.  
- **Content:** What you have, what you should have, and what you need. Without a good understanding of your content, you won't be able to create an information architecture that works well for current and future content.
- **Context:** The business or personal goals for the site: your stakeholders and constraints. If you don't know the context, you won't be able to create something that works for people and the business, and you'll have endless trouble with the project.


## What's involved in the information architecture project

An IA project always starts with figuring out what is involved:

- [ ] Define the project
- [ ] Identify goals
- [ ] Identify technologies used
- [ ] Identify design constraints
- [ ] Identify stakeholders

After defining and identifying the project, you'll start gathering information and analyzing it to help you make a wide range of decisions during the project's life. In the research and gathering phase of the project, you're finding out what the users need, what they want, and what they know. You're also learning about the content, what exists, what doesn't, and what is possible. 

Don't forget to observe user behavior and what questions they ask because these two are essential to the IA design. When I put myself into a "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom" mindset, I will watch users in their natural habitat when they reach a pain point. What do they do? Do they go to the documentation, and if so, how long do they spend before they give up? If they don't go to the official documentation, are they seeking out blogs or forums to get their answers? Directly asking them might not give you much because of their "muscle memory."

Once you've researched and learned about the user, the Information Architect (Content Designer in this case) designs the solutions with an IA structure to the defined problems and goals. At this point, testing ensures the navigation works for the specified goals. If new content needs to be prepared, this is the time to start. 

Without research into people and content, you won't be able to make good information architecture design decisions. 

## Deliverables of the information architecture project

After all of the details and IA structure have been sorted out and you know the details of how the site should work, you can start the technical work—build the site, add content, and test it before release. 

The IA deliverables include:

- The overall structure of the site.
- Groups and subgroups that will be used in navigation. This describes what is included in each and the labeling.
- Metadata that describes each page/topic, including keywords, author, reviewers, and date (last modified).

The person creating the IA is the one who understands all the ins and outs because they understand the strategy, people, and content. This means they'll explain how the information architecture should work and other details about the project. The person will also listen to feedback, answer questions, understand the underlying issues that come up, and make changes as necessary to reach the desired outcome.
