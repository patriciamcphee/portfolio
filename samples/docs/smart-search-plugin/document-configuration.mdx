Adding frontmatter metadata to your documentation files is essential for maintaining quality, enhancing user experience, and managing content efficiently.

Here's an example of frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Document Title
description: A brief description that appears in search results
keywords: [search, docusaurus, plugin]
draft: false # if set to `true`, the topic is excluded from the search index
last_update:
  date: 12/11/2024
# other metadata fields
---
```

### Understanding Metadata

Metadata is essential for creating effective documentation. Here's why:

1. **Enhanced Search & Discovery** - Strategic use of titles, descriptions, and keywords helps users quickly find relevant content through optimized search indexing
2. **Better User Experience** - Clear descriptions and structured metadata help users quickly determine if content matches their needs.
3. **Efficient Content Management** - Features like draft status and update tracking streamline documentation maintenance and version control.
4. **Organized Navigation** - Well-structured metadata powers intuitive navigation through sidebars and filters, making content easy to browse and discover.

### Metadata fields and best practices

Using metadata effectively improves documentation findability and maintenance. Always keep metadata current and relevant to maximize its value for users.

| Field | Description & Best Practice |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | A clear, descriptive heading appears in search results. Keep it concise and meaningful. |
| `description` | Brief 2-3 sentence summary shown below title. Focus on key information users need. |
| `keywords` | Specific, relevant search terms that match common user queries. Avoid generic terms. |
| `draft` | Set `draft` to `true` to exclude work-in-progress content from search and navigation. |
| `last_update:date` | Regularly updated timestamp to indicate content freshness. Update after significant changes. |
