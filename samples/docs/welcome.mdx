Welcome to my Technical Documentation Style Guide. This site serves a dual purpose: 

- A comprehensive style guide for creating clear, consistent, and user-friendly technical documentation.
- A demo site for my [smart-search-plugin](./smart-search-plugin/plugin-introduction.mdx) designed for Docusaurus v3.x projects.

## Technical documentation style guide

This site provides best practices for writing, formatting, and organizing your technical documents. You'll find guidelines on tone, terminology, and visual elements that can enhance the overall quality of your documentation and improve the user experience. By following these standards, you can create effective and engaging documentation.

## Smart-Search-Plugin demo

In addition to the style guide, this site showcases a demo of my [smart-search-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smart-search-plugin) for Docusaurus v3.x projects. This plugin enhances the search functionality by providing users with a more powerful and intuitive way to find information. The search functionality seamlessly integrates with your Docusaurus theme while maintaining the metadata-driven approach.
