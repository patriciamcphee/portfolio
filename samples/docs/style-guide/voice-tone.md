Voice is how we talk to people.  It's the interplay of personality, substance, tone, and style. 

Regardless of who we're talking to or what we're saying, we adapt our tone—from serious to empathetic to lighthearted—to fit the context and the user's state of mind. 

## Voice (Personality)

- **Expert yet approachable:** The voice is that of a knowledgeable insider — confident, well-informed, but always approachable. We use technical language where necessary but avoid jargon that can confuse.
    
- **Collaborative and inclusive:** Reflecting on the spirit of DevOps, our voice promotes teamwork and inclusivity. We address our audience as peers, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.
    
- **Pragmatic and results-oriented:** Our content is focused on delivering practical solutions and actionable insights. We prioritize clarity and brevity, always aiming to provide value.
    

## Tone (Adaptable and respectful)

- **Documentation and user guides:** Maintain a professional and instructional tone. Be concise and direct, offering step-by-step guidance. Being direct and plainspoken is not talking down. It is clear communication. 
    
- **Internal communication:** Adopt a more casual tone but maintain professionalism. Encourage open discussion and feedback, and use a friendly, team-oriented language.
    
- **Training, onboarding, and getting started guides:** Use an encouraging and supportive tone. Simplify complex concepts and provide real-world examples to aid understanding. Ensure the content is accessible to users at different levels.
    
- **Standard operating procedures:** Adopt a formal and authoritative tone. Be clear and unambiguous in presenting policies, ensuring compliance and understanding across teams. 
    
- **Customer-facing documents:** Be respectful and empathetic. Understand the customer's perspective and provide solutions that demonstrate our commitment to their success.
