<h2>Olivia, Patient Portal Assistant</h2>

Olivia is MedConnect's AI-powered chatbot integrated into a healthcare patient portal, designed to enhance the patient experience and provide convenient access to information and support. It serves as a virtual assistant, helping patients navigate the portal, access medical information, schedule appointments, and get answers to common healthcare-related questions.

It offers a user-friendly interface, secure messaging and adheres to strict privacy and security standards. Olivia continually learns from patient interactions and leverages machine-learning algorithms to improve performance.



## Scenario/Context

Megan, a Marketing Executive, recently had some blood tests done, and she wants to know when she'll get her lab results. She uses a chatbot in a patient portal to view her lab results because it offers convenience, immediate access to information, and a personalized experience. It enhances communication, empowers patients, and promotes engagement in the healthcare process.
