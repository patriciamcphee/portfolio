Thank you for taking an interest in contributing to the SCOOBY Developer Documentation. 

We've built the documentation with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and you can find the source code our [scooby-docs-next GitHub repo][repo].

You're welcome to contribute to the documentation to help make it better and we want to make it possible for you to become a contributor. Additionally, anyone can open an issue about documentation or suggest a change with a [pull request (PR)][pr] to the [GitHub repository][repo]. 

This topic outlines the different ways that you can get involved. In addition, it provides some of the resources that are available to help you get started. All feedback is welcome. 

## Before you start

- You are familiar with Git and GitHub, and [markdown](/markdown-reference). We use basic markdown, extended markdown, and Docusaurus-specific markdown.
- Review the [documentation repo's][repo] organization and structure. 
- Familiarize yourself with our style guide.
- Verify that you can open a [pull request][pr] and review changes.
- Ensure an [issue][issues] exists. 
- If the solution you are proposing is complex, prose it anyway and wait for one of the core contributors to approve it before implementing it. This helps in shorter turnaround times in merging PRs.
  
  




## When to contribute

When relying on others to draft and review documentation, it makes sense to have a process to make it more productive and encouraging for everyone. 

The acceptance criteria for contributing to SCOOBY developer documentation is:

### Does the topic or doc exist?

- If yes, update the doc! Contribute to your heart's content. But first, determine which use case best fits your update:

  - **[Minor changes:](#edit-content-minor-changes) (use case #1)** If you only need to fix a typo or make a clarification to a sentence or section, this option is your ideal choice. However, in this use case, you cannot upload files, such as an image, and you can update only one file.
    
  - **[Significant changes:](#edit-content-significant-changes) (use case #2)** Suppose you need to make substantial changes, such as adding an image or editing multiple topics. In that case, this method is your best friend, as you'll have one pull request to manage. Consult with the Sr. Technical Writer first before making changes.

- If not, should it? If so, consider **[adding it](#add-new-content) (use case #3)**, but don't add a topic or doc just because you can. Consult with the Sr. Technical Writer first before adding. For example, your new topic could be added to an existing one, consolidating and clarifying the information. It's also possible that someone else is working on a similar topic. 


The Sr. Technical Writer maintains the content's quality, reduces duplication, and provides a consistent user experience. They can also strategize how to deliver complex information—for example, adding an explainer video (&#060;90 secs) can help with complex scenarios or issues.

### Best practices

To promote consistency, follow the guidelines below and mentioned throughout to keep the process productive and beneficial for all involved.

- [ ] Always create a *working branch* whenever you introduce a set of logically related changes. This helps you manage your changes through the workflow. We refer to it here as a working branch because it's a workspace to iterate or refine your changes until they can be integrated into the default branch. 

- [ ] The in-browser editing experience is best for minor or infrequent changes. 

- [ ] Always consult with the Sr. Technical Writer when adding topics or want to propose changes to the content structure. The Sr. Technical Writer maintains the content's quality, reduces duplication, and provides a consistent user experience. They can also strategize how to deliver complex information—for example, adding an explainer video (&#060;90 secs) can help with complex scenarios or issues.

- [ ] Always keep your branch up-to-date. 


## Edit content (minor changes)

If you only need to fix a typo or clarify a sentence or section, this option is your best choice. It streamlines the process of reporting and correcting minor errors and omissions in the documentation.  

Despite all efforts, small grammar and spelling errors _do_ make their way into our published documents. While you can create GitHub issues to report mistakes, creating a PR to fix the issue is faster and easier when the option is available.

1. In the [repo][repo], navigate to the /docs folder and locate the file you want to edit. Then, select the pencil icon to edit the article. 

   ![GitHub Edit file icon](../../images/github-edit-file.png)

2. Edit the file in the web editor. Choose the **Preview** tab to check the formatting of your changes.

   ![GitHub Preview changes](../../images/github-preview-changes.png)

3. When you're finished editing, scroll to the bottom of the page and propose your changes. 

   1. In the **Commit changes** area, enter a title and an optional description for your changes. The title will be the first line of the commit message. 

   2. Select the option to create a branch and then  **Propose changes** to commit your changes.
   
     ![GitHub propose and commit changes](../../images/github-commit-proposed-changes.png)

4. Now that you've proposed and committed your changes, you need to ask the owners to review your changes. This is done using a pull request (PR). 

   Enter a title and a description for the PR, and then select **Create pull request**. You can select **Create a draft pull request** instead. The difference is that the reviewers are notified only when the PR is *Open* rather than *Draft*.

   ![GitHub propose and commit changes](../../images/github-open-pull-request.png)


That's it! Team members will review your PR and merge it when approved. You may get feedback requesting changes.


## Edit content (significant changes)

If you need to make substantial changes, add an image or add a section to a topic. On the other hand, if your change is minor that doesn't involve uploading a file or making changes to multiple files, follow the [Edit content - minor change](#edit-content-minor-changes) instructions.

1. Make sure you're back on the main (default) branch so you can sync your local working branch.

   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Create a working branch for your proposed changes. For example, **content-dev-faqs** or **update-visual-guidelines**.

   ```
   git checkout -b {branch-name}
   ```

3. Navigate to /docs and locate the topic you want to change. 

4. Change the date in the metadata and ensure the title, description, and author are correct. Add any additional keywords if they are missing.

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: Welcome to Scooby AI
    id: welcome
    description: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Orci nulla pellentesque dignissim enim sit amet venenatis. Nulla at volutpat diam ut venenatis. Non nisi est sit amet facilisis magna etiam tempor orci. Hendrerit dolor magna eget est lorem ipsum dolor. '

    hide_table_of_contents: false
    displayed_sidebar: mySidebar
   ---
   ```

4. Make your changes to the content and run the following command to build and review your changes.

   ```
   yarn start
   ```

   This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. If a browser window doesn't open, go to **http://localhost:3000/** to view your local changes.   

   <Alert severity="info" color="success">
      <AlertTitle>Tip!</AlertTitle>
      It's best practice to run the following command to ensure your changes didn't introduce a breaking change.
      <pre>npm run clear<br />yarn build</pre>
   </Alert>


5. Add your changes.

   ```
   git add --all
   ```

6. Commit your changes.

   ```
   git commit -m "short description of the change"
   ```

7. Publish, or push, your changes to the main repo for merging. 

   ```
   git push --set-upstream origin {branch name}
   ```

8. From the main (default) branch, select **Compare & pull request**.

9. Provide additional information, add reviewers, and select **Create pull request**.

   Alternatively, you can select **Create draft pull request**.

10. After going through the review process for technical accuracy and a copy edit from a Content Designer, enter `#sign-off` and select **Comment**.

   Your changes get merged into the default branch (`main`).  After each merge, the Sr. Technical Writer reviews all merges, fixes any merge conflicts, and publishes all changes.




## Add new content

1. Make sure you're back on the main (default) branch so you can sync your local working branch.

   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Create a working branch for your proposed changes. For example, **content-dev-faqs** or **update-visual-guidelines**.

   ```
   git checkout -b {branch-name}
   ```

3. Navigate to `/docs` and locate the subdirectory for your new topic.

4. Add the metadata (frontmatter).

   Keywords are optional but helpful. All other metadata is required.

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: Welcome to Scooby AI
    id: welcome
    description: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Orci nulla pellentesque dignissim enim sit amet venenatis. Nulla at volutpat diam ut venenatis. Non nisi est sit amet facilisis magna etiam tempor orci. Hendrerit dolor magna eget est lorem ipsum dolor. '
    slug: /
    keywords: 
     - welcome
     - intro
     - about
     - services
    pagination_next: null
    pagination_prev: null
    last_update: 
       date: 03/29/2023
       author: Bambam McGee
    draft: true
    doc_type: overview
    product: scoobyAi
    hide_table_of_contents: false
    displayed_sidebar: mySidebar
    ---
    ```

5. Add the new markdown file in the sidebar.js file.

   ```javascript
   {
     type: 'category',
     label: 'Content',
     link: {
       type: 'doc',
       id: 'content/content-overview',
     },      
     items: [ 
      'content/language-inclusivity', 
      'content/grammar-mechanics', 
      'content/voice-tone-principles', 
      'content/in-product-word-list', 
      'content/writing-for-errors', 
      'content/writing-guidelines' 
      ],
   },
   ```
   
   It's a best practice to add the markdown file early in the content development phase. Otherwise, you'll get an error when you run the command to build and review your content.

6. Create your content and run the following command to build and review your changes.

   ```
   yarn start
   ```

   This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. If a browser window doesn't open, go to **http://localhost:3000/** to view your local changes.   

   <Alert severity="info" color="success">

      It's best practice to run the following command to ensure your changes didn't introduce a breaking change.
      <pre>npm run clear<br />yarn build</pre>
   </Alert>

7. When ready, commit and publish your changes to the main (default) branch, add your changes.

   ```
   git add --all
   ```

8. Commit your changes with a descriptive summary, for example, *add clarity to the data table component usage examples*.

   ```
   git commit -m "short description of the change"
   ```

9. Publish, or push, your changes to the main repo for merging. 

   ```
   git push --set-upstream origin {branch name}
   ```

10. From the main (default) branch, select **Compare & pull request**.


11. Provide additional information, add reviewers, and select **Create pull request**.

    Alternatively, you can select **Create draft pull request**.

12. After going through the review process for technical accuracy and a copy edit from a Content Designer, enter `#sign-off` and select **Comment**.

    Your changes get merged into the default branch (`main`).  After each merge, the Sr. Technical Writer reviews all merges, fixes any merge conflicts, and publishes all changes.
