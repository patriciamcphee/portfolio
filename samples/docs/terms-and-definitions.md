## ContentOps

**Content Operations** - A set of practices, processes, and tools used to manage, produce, and deliver content efficiently and effectively. 

## Content strategy
In technical documentation, content strategy refers to the planning, development, management, and maintenance of information tailored to a technical audience. This strategy is essential for ensuring the documentation is effective, efficient, and user-friendly.  Content strategy equals continuous discovery (which is based on the metrics and analytics).

Here are a few key aspects of a content strategy in technical documentation:
- **Content planning:** Deciding what type of content is needed. This includes determining the scope of the documentation, such as whether it should include FAQs, reference materials, etc. 
- **Structured writing:** Organizing content in a logical, coherent manner. This often involves using a modular approach, where information is broken down into manageable sections that can be easily updated and reused
- **Maintenance and updates:** Regularly reviewing and updating the content to ensure it remains accurate and relevant. This is crucial as products and services evolve. 
- **Metrics and analytics:** Using tools to track how the documentation is being used, which can provide insights into what content is most useful or needs improvement. 

## UX
**User Experience** - The overall experience of a person using a product, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use.  In the case of DevOps, we're focused more on the documentation to complete a task.  For example, a bad user experience would include things like poor structure and organization, outdated or inaccurate content, or overwhelming volume of information.  An example of a great user experience when it comes to technical documentation include well-structured content that easy to navigate, clear and comprehensive yet focused, or visual aids and real-life scenarios or examples. 

## Taxonomy
The practice and science of classification or arrangement of content elements into structured categories. 

## Content audit
A comprehensive analysis and assessment of all content elements and assets. 

## Accessibility
Good writing principles take into account the diverse backgrounds of the audience.  This includes language proficiency, cultural differences, and varying levels of technical knowledge. Well-crafted content helps make the documentation accessible to a wider audience.
