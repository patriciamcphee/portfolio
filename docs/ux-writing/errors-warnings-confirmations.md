Writing error messages can be a challenge because you want them to be short and concise. Your overall goal is to provide guidance to the user and prevent deadends.  Does the message give the user the next steps on how to fix it themselves?  For example, if they get "Invalid or unsupported" error, do the users know what to do next? This message is a deadend message.  It doesn't tell the user what supported files to try to get past the error.
