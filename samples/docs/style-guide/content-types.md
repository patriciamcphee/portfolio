              <li>Generally presented in a narrative format, discussing concepts in a logical, often sequential manner.</li>
              <li>More likely to be read once or occasionally to build foundational understanding.</li>

<summary>What's the difference between a Getting Started and How-to topic?</summary>

Both serve distinct but complementary purposes. While both aim to assist users in understanding and using a product, service, or tool, they differ in scope, detail, and intended user.

#### Similarities

- Both are designed to provide step-by-step assistance, helping users accomplish specific tasks or understand product functionalities. They are usually sequential, guiding users through a logical order.
- Both focus on the user's perspective, presenting information clearly and easily digestibly.
- Both often incorporate visuals like screenshots, diagrams, or videos to enhance understanding.

<summary>What's the difference between a Tutorial and a How-to topic?</summary>

Both How-to and Tutorial topics are essential components of technical documentation that guide users through specific processes or tasks. While they share some similarities, they also have distinct characteristics that set them apart. 

#### Similarities

- Both provide structured, sequential instructions to help users achieve a specific outcome.
- They focus on completing a particular task or process, though Tutorials tend to offer more context.
- Both offer clear instructions on accomplishing something, with Tutorials typically providing more in-depth explanations.
