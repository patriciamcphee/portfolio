<h2>About Me!</h2>

My journey into user-centric writing started over 20 years ago on a human-centered design and engineering team at a large telecommunications company. There, I learned how to conduct usability tests (participant observation and user behavior) to uncover and solve user experience challenges with end-user documentation.

I'm a word nerd who loves to explain complex concepts in simple language. I can spot ambiguities and logical inconsistencies from a mile away and get a kick out of style guides. I know when to follow the rules and when to break them.

  <p><b>Conversation Design/Conversation Copywriting</b>: I create conversational experiences that are engaging, user-centric, and deliver value to users in a wide range of applications and platforms. My technical writing skills can be applied to conversation design through a user-centric approach, structured content, adaptability to different audiences, and research and adaptation. Similarly, my voice-over work provides transferable skills in conveying emotions, scriptwriting, understanding user experience, and creating variety to enhance user engagement.</p>

  <p><b>UX Writing</b>: I develop clear and helpful text in product interfaces to help users reach a specific goal, whether completing a form or tapping a button. This includes content from online help systems, user onboarding, and in-app messages to push notifications and tooltips.</p>

  <p><b>Content strategy</b>: I help <i>improve</i> the quality, relevance, and effectiveness of your end-user content, leading to better user experiences, increased engagement, and better business outcomes. Information grows and changes over time in response to the users' needs. This means determining when the amount or types of information are no longer suitable or when there's a shift in context or users.</p>

<h2>About this site</h2>

I used [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to build this writing portfolio. I started using Docusaurus at the beginning of 2020 and continue to play around with customization. Before that, I used other static-site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, and DocFx as my primary authoring environment. So far, my favorite is Docusaurus. Although I like DocFx, it's a bit more complicated to set up.

The purpose of using the Docusaurus framework to host my writing samples was to make it easier to share and showcase my work!
