FitFuel+ is a lifestyle brand that aims to be a comprehensive fitness partner providing personalized support, guidance, nutrition advice, and plant-based protein powder to elevate users' performance. 

FitFuel+ aims to address the challenge of individuals seeking effective fitness support and guidance to achieve their fitness goals:

- Many individuals struggle to create personalized workout routines that align with their fitness goals, abilities, and preferences.
- Finding high-quality protein powder products that complement their workout routines can be challenging, leading to confusion and potentially choosing products that don't meet their needs.

The bot's purpose is to provide personalized workout routines to each user's fitness level, preferences, and goals. It can create dynamic and adaptive workout plans that can evolve with the user's progress. Additionally, it aims to promote the sale of protein powder as a supplement to support their fitness journey.

## Use case - Personalized workout routine

Sarah, a retired accountant, is at home, comfortably settled in her reading nook with a cup of herbal tea. Her computer is open before her, displaying a health blog focused on senior fitness. She's reading an article about the importance of exercise for seniors. The article highlights various concerns that she's been thinking about lately, such as maintaining bone health and improving overall mobility.

As she scrolls through the article, Sarah can't help but think about how she's feeling sluggish lately. Her energy levels have dipped, and she's keen to make lifestyle changes to allow her to live her retirement years to the fullest. She wonders, "What if there was a way to incorporate simple, tailored exercises into my daily routine? What would be the most effective yet gentle approach?"

As Sarah scrolls down the article, she notices an advertisement for FitFuel+ that catches her eye. It talks about personalized fitness guidance and plant-based protein powder. She clicks on it out of curiosity.
