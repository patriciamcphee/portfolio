1. Make sure you're back on the main (default) branch so you can sync your local working branch.

2. Create a working branch for your proposed changes. For example, **content-dev-faqs** or **update-visual-guidelines**.

   Whenever you introduce a set of logically related changes, it's a best practice to create a *working branch* to manage your changes through the workflow. We refer to it here as a working branch because it\'s a workspace to iterate/refine changes until they can be integrated into the default branch.

   Isolating related changes to a specific branch gives you control when introducing changes. For example, your changes may target a particular release or launch of a new feature.   

3. Navigate to /docs and locate the topic you want to change. 

4. Change the date in the metadata and ensure the title, description, and author are correct. Add any additional keywords if they are missing.

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: A11y Prerequisites
   permalink: 'a11y/a11y-prerequisites'
   description: 'Learn about guidance and resources on creating accessible and inclusive experiences. 
   Our guidance is based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards.'
   keywords:
     - a11y
     - prerequisites
   last_update: 
     date: 09/20/2022

5. Make your changes to the content and run the following command to build and review your changes.

   ```
   yarn start
   ```

   This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. If a browser window doesn\'t open, go to **http://localhost:3000/egds/docs-next/** to view your local changes. 

6. When ready, commit and publish your changes to the upstream repo.

7. From the main (default) branch, select **Compare & pull request**.

8. Provide additional information, add reviewers, and select **Create pull request**.

   Alternatively, you can select **Create draft pull request**.

9. After going through the review process for technical accuracy and a copy edit from a Content Designer, enter `#sign-off` and select **Comment**.

   Your changes get merged into the default branch (`main`).  After each merge, the Lead Content Designer on the EGDS core team reviews all merges, fixes any merge conflicts, and publishes all changes.
