I used [Docusaurus v2.2](https://docusaurus.io) for my writing samples, GitHub Pages to host the site, and markdown to write the content. I originally built it in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to challenge myself in 2018 to showcase my writing samples online rather than PDF format. 

Around 2015, I started using markdown more as the primary format for content, mainly in Confluence and other wiki platforms. In 2018, I started using static-site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Docusaurus, and DocFX as a primary authoring environment. My favorite, so far, has been Docusuarus. I like DocFX, but it's a bit more complicated to set up.
